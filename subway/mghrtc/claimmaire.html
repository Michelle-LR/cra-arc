			<h2 id="h-1">When to claim</h2>


			<p>You can only claim the MHRTC for a particular renovation in the tax year that the renovation period ends, even if the renovation took more than one year. The renovation period:
			<ul class="fa-ul">
<li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span> Begins when the first qualifying expenditure is made or incurred for a qualifying renovation (for example, when you apply for a building permit)</li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>
Ends when the qualifying renovation is completed (for example, when the qualifying renovation passes the final inspection or proof of project completion is received)</li>
</ul>

		 <details><summary>Example: Renovation ends in 2024</summary>
			 <p>Kwame completed a qualifying renovation for his mother-in-law to live in a separate unit in his house, and intends to claim the MHRTC on his tax return. His first expense for this renovation was incurred in April 2023. The renovation passed the final inspection and was completed in July 2024. </p>
			 <p>Regardless of when the renovation started, the MHRTC must be claimed in the year the renovation was completed. If Kwame meets all of the eligibility criteria, he can claim the MHRTC on his 2024 tax return.</p>
			
			
			
            
				 </details>
		 
		  <h2 id="h-2">Splitting the credit between eligible individuals</h2>
	   <p>When two or more individuals share the costs for the same qualifying renovation, the credit may be split between them as long as <strong>all</strong> of the following conditions are met:
	   <ul><li>Each person claiming the MHRTC is an <strong>eligible individual</strong>
	   	<p>
			Refer to: <a href="who.html">Who can claim</a></p></li>
			   <li>The <strong>total</strong> amount claimed between all eligible individuals is <strong>not</strong> more than the maximum</li>
			   <li>The eligible individuals claim only qualifying expenditures that they incurred</li>
		   <li>No MHRTC has previously been claimed for the <strong>qualifying individual</strong> (the person 65 years of age or older, or adult who qualifies for the disability tax credit)</li>
	   </ul>
	   
	   <details>
		   <summary>Example: Splitting the maximum credit between two eligible individuals</summary>
<p>Rey and Jax shared the cost of a qualifying renovation in 2023. Both Rey and Jax are eligible individuals and may claim their portion of the qualifying expenses on their returns.</p>
		   <p>The total amount of qualifying expenses Rey and Jax incurred for the renovation was $62,000.</p>
<p>Rey’s qualifying expenses were $29,000.</p>
<p>Jax’s qualifying expenses were $33,000.</p>
<p>Because the maximum amount of expenses that can be claimed for the MHRTC is $50,000, Rey and Jax must decide how they will split the credit. Each of them could claim up to the maximum amount of qualifying expenses they incurred, as long as the total for the claim is not more than $50,000. </p>
	
		   <p><strong>One option</strong> is for Rey and Jax decide to claim the credit according to the portion of expenses each of them incurred:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rey’s portion of maximum claim: $29,000 &divide; $62, 000 &equals; 47%</li>
	<li><strong>Amount of expenses Rey would claim:</strong> $50,000 &times; 47% &equals; <strong>$23,500</strong></li>
<li>Jax’s portion of maximum claim: $33,000 &divide; $62, 000 &equals; 53%</li>
	<li><strong>Amount of expenses Jax would claim:</strong> $50,000 &times; 53% &equals; <strong>$26,500</strong></li>
		   </ul>
		   
		   <p><strong>Another option</strong> would be to maximize the claim that one person can get, while the other person claims the remaining allowable amount (up to either the maximum total MHRTC or the amount of qualifying expenses each incurred). </p>

<p>Splitting the credit so Rey can claim as much as possible:</p>
		   <ul>
<li><strong>Amount of expenses Rey would claim: $29,000</strong> (limited to the expenses Rey incurred)</li>
<li><strong>Amount of expenses Jax would claim:</strong> $50,000 (maximum claim) - $29,000 (Rey’s portion) = <strong>$21,000</strong></li>
			   </ul>

			   <p>Splitting the credit so Jax can claim as much as possible:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Amount of expenses Rey would claim:</strong> $50,000 (maximum claim) - $33,000 (Jax’s portion) = <strong>$17,000</strong></li>
<li><strong>Amount of expenses Jax would claim: $33,000</strong> (limited to the expenses Jax incurred) </li>
			   </ul>
		   
		   
	   </details>
            <h2 id="h-3">Where to enter the claim on your return</h2>
		 <p>For 2023 and later tax years, the MHRTC can be claimed on <strong>line 45355</strong> of your income tax and benefit return.</p>
		 <p>Use Schedule 12, Multigenerational Home Renovation Tax Credit, to report your expenses related to the MHRTC and calculate the total credit you may claim.</p>
		 <p>You may claim more than one qualifying renovation in the same year.</p> <p> Learn more:  <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/subway/mghrtc/expensesmaire.html">Expenses you can claim</a<>/p>

				<h2 id="h-4">Keep your supporting documents</h2>
    
        <p>Your supporting documents must clearly identify the type and number of goods bought or services provided, such as:
</p>
<ul class="fa-ul">
<li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>Information that clearly identifies the vendor/contractor, their business address, and their GST/HST registration number, if any
</li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>A description of the goods and the date they were bought</li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>The date when the goods were delivered (keep your delivery slip as proof) or when the work or services were performed, or both

</li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>A description of the work done, including the address

</li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>The amount of the invoice
</li>

<li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>Proof of payment<br>(Receipts or invoices must show payment in full or be accompanied by other proof of payment, such as a credit card slip or cancelled cheque)</li>
</ul>
<p>To check whether someone is registered for GST/HST, refer to: <a href="https://canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-businesses/confirming-a-gst-hst-account-number.html">GST/HST Registry</a></p>

    


<h2 id="h-5">Impact on other credits and benefits</h2>
<p>Expenses that may be included in an MHRTC claim must be reduced by any expenses that can reasonably be considered to have been reimbursed. This includes any form of assistance that you receive, or are entitled to receive, including any related rebates, such as those for GST/HST.
</p>
		 <p>You <strong>cannot</strong> claim the same expense for more than one credit. This means you cannot claim expenses that you included in your MHRTC claim for the medical expense tax credit or the home accessibility tax credit, or vice versa.</p>
