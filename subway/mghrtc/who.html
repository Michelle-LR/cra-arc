		   <summary>A family sharing the cost of a renovation</summary>
		<p>Fatima, Ali, and Abdul are adult siblings:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Fatima owns her own house</li>
			<li>Ali lives in a house Fatima owns</li>
			<li>Abdul lives in a separate house that he owns</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Their father, Yusuf, is 78 years old and no longer able to live independently. Together, the family decides that the best living situation will be for Yusuf to live with Ali. They decide to add a second story to the existing house that Ali lives in that has a separate entrance, bedroom, bathroom, and kitchen. Ali will move to the apartment upstairs and Yusuf will live on the main floor of the house. Abdul, Fatima, and Yusuf agree to share the cost of the renovation, while Ali will not contribute to the cost of the renovation but will continue paying the utilities for the property and will help care for Yusuf when he moves in.</p>
		<p>The renovation begins in July 2023 and is completed by November 2023. Yusuf moves in to Ali's house in December 2023.</p>
		<p>In this situation, the MHRTC may be split and claimed by Fatima and Yusuf on their 2023 returns.</p>
		<p>Yusuf may claim the eligible renovation expenses that he incurred because he is over 65 years of age and the new secondary unit allows him to live with his son Ali (a qualifying relation).</p>
		<p>Fatima may claim the eligible renovation expenses that she incurred because:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>She is a qualifying relation of Yusuf (the qualifying individual)</li>
				<li>She owns the house that was renovated to create the secondary unit that allows Yusuf (the qualifying individual) to live with Ali (a qualifying relation)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Abdul <strong>cannot</strong> claim his expenses related to the renovation on his return as part of the MHRTC because he does not own and does not occupy the dwelling that Yusuf moved into.</p>
		<p>Ali <strong>cannot</strong> claim the MHRTC on his return because he did not incur any eligible expenses related to the renovation.</p>
		<p>The <strong>maximum</strong> amount of the MHRTC that may be claimed for this renovation is <strong>$7,500</strong>. If the eligible expenses that Yusuf and Fatima incurred were over the maximum, they must agree on the portion of the credit that each will claim on their returns and keep their receipts to show the eligible expenses that each of them incurred. Neither Yusuf nor Fatima may claim the expenses that Abdul incurred.</p>

		   <summary>An adult with a disability building a secondary unit for a caregiver</summary>
		 <p>Martin is an adult who qualifies for the disability tax credit. He recently decided to finish the basement of his house into a separate apartment so that he can hire a live-in caregiver. The apartment will have a separate entrance, bedroom, kitchen, and bathroom.</p>
		<p>After the apartment renovation is completed, Martin hires a live-in caregiver who moves into the unit. The caregiver is not related to Martin.</p>
		<p>Although Martin may be able to claim some of these caregiving expenses another way, he <strong>cannot</strong> claim the renovation as part of the MHRTC because the caregiver who moved in is not his relative. To be eligible to claim the MHRTC, the newly renovated apartment must allow Martin to live with a qualifying relation.</p>

		   <summary>Adding an extra bedroom for an elderly relative</summary>
		<p>Mo's father recently died and their mother Viv now needs live-in care to meet her day-to-day needs. To accommodate Viv's needs, Mo decides to convert their large sunroom into a bedroom with an ensuite bathroom so Viv can move in. There is a separate entrance to the sunroom from the back of the house. Mo does not add a kitchen to the newly renovated space because Viv will not be cooking for herself.</p>
		<p>Mo <strong>cannot</strong> claim the MHRTC for this renovation, because the newly renovated space does not qualify as a secondary unit. To qualify, a secondary unit must have a separate entrance, bedroom, bathroom, and kitchen.</p>
		 </details>
	<details>
		   <summary>Building a separate unit for a relative who moves in the following year</summary>
		 <p>Javi's aunt Lucie recently turned 65. While Lucie is still able to live independently, she can no longer manage the upkeep on her large house and wants to downsize to live closer to family. Javi's local laws allow him to have two housing units on his one acre property, so he decides to build a small separate house for Lucie to live in on his property. The new house will have a small bedroom, kitchen, and bathroom. Javi starts the renovation in April 2023.</p>
<p>The new house is completed and ready for Lucie to move in by October 2024. However, it takes Lucie longer than anticipated to sell her old home and she doesn't move to the new unit at Javi's house until April 2025.</p>
		<p>Assuming Javi has eligible expenses relating to this renovation that were not reimbursed or claimed, he <strong>will be eligible to claim the MHRTC on his 2024 tax return</strong>, because:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The renovation was completed in 2024</li>
			<li>The new unit meets all of the necessary requirements to qualify as a secondary unit</li>
			<li>Lucie is a qualifying individual who is 65 years of age or older at the end of the tax year she's making the claim for</li>
			<li>Lucie will be sharing the dwelling with her nephew Javi (a qualifying relation)</li>
			<li>Lucie intends to occupy the secondary unit within 12 months of its completion</li>
		</ul>
