		   <summary>Family sharing the cost of a renovation</summary>
		 <p>Abdul, Fatima, and Ali are adult siblings. Fatima owns her own house, as well as a second house that her brother Ali lives in. Abdul lives in his own separate house.</p>
		<p>Their father, Yusuf, is 78 years old and no longer able to live independently. Together, the family decides that the best living situation will be for Yusuf to live with Ali. They decide to add a second story to the existing house that Ali lives in, with a separate entrance, bedroom, bathroom, and kitchen. Ali will move to the apartment upstairs, and Yusuf will live on the main floor of the house. Abdul, Fatima, and Yusuf agree to share the costs of the renovation equally between the three of them, while Ali will not contribute to the cost of the renovation but will continue paying the utilities for the property and will help care for Yusuf once he moves in.</p>
		<p>The renovation begins in July 2023 and is completed by November 2023. Yusuf moves in to Ali's house in December of that year.</p>
		<p>In this situation, the MHRTC may be split between <strong>two</strong> people on their 2023 tax returns: Fatima and Yusuf.</p>
		<p>Yusuf may claim the eligible renovation expenses he incurred because he is over 65, and the new secondary unit allows him to live with his qualifying relation, his son Ali.</p>
		<p>Fatima may claim the eligible renovation expenses she incurred because:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>She is a qualifying relation of Yusuf, the qualifying individual</li>
				<li>She owns the house that was renovated to create the secondary unit that allows Yusuf (the qualifying individual) to live with Ali (a qualifying relation)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Abdul may <strong>not</strong> claim his expenses related to the renovation on his tax return as part of the MHRTC, because he neither owns nor occupies the dwelling that Yusuf moved into.</p>
		<p>Ali may <strong>not</strong> claim the MHRTC on his tax return because he did not incur any eligible expenses related to the renovation.</p>
		 </details>
	<details>
		   <summary>An adult with a disability building a secondary unit for a caregiver</summary>
		 <p>Martin is an adult who qualifies for the Disability Tax Credit. He has recently decided to finish the basement of his house into a separate apartment, so that he can hire a live-in caregiver. The apartment will have a separate entrance, bedroom, kitchen, and bathroom.</p>
		<p>When the apartment is complete, Martin hires a live-in caregiver who moves into the unit. The caregiver is unrelated to Martin.</p>
		<p>Although Martin may be able to claim some of these caregiving expenses another way, he may <strong>not</strong> claim the renovation as part of the MHRTC because the caregiver who moved in is not a relative of his. To be eligible to claim the MHRTC, the newly renovated apartment must allow Martin to live with a qualifying relation.</p>

		   <summary>Adding an extra bedroom for an elderly relative</summary>
		<p>Maura's father recently died, and her mother Viv now needs live-in care to meet her day-to-day needs. To accommodate Viv's needs, Maura decides to convert her large sunroom into a bedroom with an ensuite bathroom, so her mother can move in with her and her family. There is a separate entrance to the sunroom from the back of the house. Maura does not add a kitchen to the newly renovated space because Viv does will not be cooking for herself.</p>
		<p>Maura will <strong>not</strong> be able to claim the MHRTC for this renovation, because the newly renovated space does not qualify as a secondary unit. To qualify, a secondary unit must have a separate entrance, bedroom, bathroom, and kitchen.</p>

		   <summary>Building a separate unit for a relative who moves in the following year</summary>
		 <p>Javi's aunt Lucie has recently turned 65. While she is still able to live independently, she can no longer manage the upkeep on her large house and wants to downsize and live closer to family. Javi's local laws allow him to have two housing units on his one acre property, so he decides to build a small separate house for Lucie to live in on his property. The new house will have a small bedroom, kitchen, and bathroom.</p>
<p>Javi starts the renovation in April 2023. The new house is completed and ready for Lucie to move in by October 2024. However, it takes Lucie longer than anticipated to sell her old home, and she doesn't move to the new unit at Javi's house until April 2025.</p>
		<p>Assuming Javi has eligible expenses related to this renovation that were not otherwise reimbursed or claimed, he <strong>will be eligible to claim the MHRTC on his 2024 tax return</strong>, because:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The renovation was completed in 2024</li>
			<li>The new unit meets all necessary requirements to qualify as a secondary unit of Javi's eligible dwelling</li>
			<li>Lucie is a qualifying individual who is over 65 years old at the end of the tax year she's making the claim</li>
			<li>Lucie will be sharing the dwelling with Javi, who is a qualifying relation (her nephew)</li>
			<li>Lucie intended to occupy the secondary unit within 12 months of its completion</li>
		</ul>
