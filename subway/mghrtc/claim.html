			<h2 id="h-1">When to claim</h2>


			<p>You can only claim the MHRTC for a particular renovation <strong>once</strong>. The claim must be made in the tax year that the renovation period ends. The renovation period:
			<ul class="fa-ul">
<li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span> Begins when the first qualifying expenditure is made or incurred for a qualifying renovation (for example, when you apply for a building permit)</li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>
Ends when the qualifying renovation is completed (for example, when the qualifying renovation passes the final inspection or proof of project completion is received)</li>
</ul>

		 <details><summary>Example: Renovation ends in 2024</summary>
			 <p>Kwame completed a qualifying renovation for his mother-in-law to live in a separate unit in his house, and intends to claim the MHRTC on his tax return. His first expense for this renovation was incurred in April 2023. The renovation passed the final inspection and was completed in July 2024. </p>
			 <p>Regardless of when the renovation started, the MHRTC must be claimed in the year the renovation was completed. if Kwame meets all of the eligibility criteria, he can claim the MHRTC on his 2024 tax return.</p>
			
			
			
            
				 </details>
            <h2 id="h-2">Where to enter the claim on your return</h2>
            <p>For 2023 and subsequent tax years the MHRTC can be claimed on the T1 income tax and benefit return on line 45355.</p>
		 <p>You will use schedule 12 to calculate and report expenses related to the MHRTC, and calculate the total credit you may claim.</p>
			

<!--<h3>Claiming electronically versus on paper</h3>
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
<dt>Electronic filing</dt><dd>

<dt>

</dd>
</dl>-->
				<h2 id="h-3">Keep your supporting documents</h2>
    
        <p>Your supporting documents must clearly identify the type and number of goods bought or services provided, such as:
</p>
<ul class="fa-ul">
<li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>Information that clearly identifies the vendor/contractor, their business address, and their GST/HST registration number, if any
</li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>A description of the goods and the date they were bought</li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>The date when the goods were delivered (keep your delivery slip as proof) or when the work or services were performed, or both

</li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>A description of the work done, including the address

</li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>The amount of the invoice
</li>

<li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>Proof of payment<br>(Receipts or invoices must show payment in full or be accompanied by other proof of payment, such as a credit card slip or cancelled cheque)</li>
</ul>
<p>To check whether someone is registered for GST/HST, refer to: <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-businesses/confirming-a-gst-hst-account-number.html">GST/HST Registry</a></p>

    


<h2 id="h-4">Impact on other credits and benefits</h2>
<p>Expenses that may be included in an MHRTC claim must be reduced by any expenses that can reasonably be considered to have been reimbursed. This includes any form of assistance that you receive, or are entitled to receive, including any related rebates, such as those for GST/HST.
</p>
		 <p>You <strong>cannot</strong> claim the same expense for more than one credit. This means you cannot claim expenses that you included in your your MHRTC claim for the medical expense tax credit or the home accessibility tax credit, or vice versa.</p>
