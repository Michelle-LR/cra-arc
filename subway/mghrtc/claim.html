			<h2 id="h-1">When to claim</h2>


			<p>You only make the claim <strong>once</strong>. The claim is made in the taxation year that the renovation period ends. The "renovation period" is a period that:
			<ul class="fa-ul">
<li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span> Begins at the time that the first qualifying expenditure is made or incurred for a qualifying renovation (for example, when you apply for a building permit)</li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>
Ends at the time of the completion of the qualifying renovation (for example, when the qualifying renovation passes the final inspection or proof of project completion is received)</li>
</ul>
<p>The renovation period tax year is the tax year that includes the end of the renovation period of the qualifying renovation.</p><details><summary>Example: Renovation ends in 2024</summary><p>Regardless of when the renovations started, it can only be claimed once, in the year it ended. In a situation where the renovation is completed in 2024,  it means the renovation expenses are claim on the 2024 tax return.</p>
			
			
			
            
				 </details>
            <h2 id="h-2">Claim on the tax return</h2>
            <p>For 2023 and subsequent taxation years the MHRTC can be claimed on the T1 income tax and benefit return, <strong>line 45355</strong>.</p>
			 <details>
                    <summary>Example: If an expense has already been claimed</summary>
                  
    

    
        <p>Expenses are not eligible for the to be claimed more than once.  For example, if the expense was already claimed under the medical expense tax credit (METC) or the home accessibility tax credit (HATC), you cannot claim it under the Multigenerational home renovation tax credit (MHRTC).</p>

    




                </details>
			<p>The person who makes the claim is person who incurred the renovation expenses.</p>
			

			
				
				
				<details><summary>If more than one eligible individual makes an MHRTC claim</summary>
<p>If more than one eligible individual makes an MHRTC claim for the same qualifying renovation, the total of all amounts claimed must not be more than $50,000. If the individuals cannot agree on what portion of the amounts each can claim, the Minister of National Revenue may decide the portions.
