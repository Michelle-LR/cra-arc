<p>Only one qualifying renovation can be claimed during the lifetime of a qualifying individual.</p>
    
        <p>The MHRTC is 15% of <strong>whichever is less</strong>:</p>

		<!-- <p>When you complete your tax return, you will use schedule 12 to calculate the amount of MHRTC you can claim.</p>
		 	<p>Refer to: <a href="claim.html">How to claim</a></p>-->
<p>Since this tax credit is refundable, you will receive a refund if the credit you claim is <strong>more</strong> than the taxes you owe.</p>
<h3>Example: Claiming the maximum amount of the MHRTC</h3>
		 <p>Jackie is eligible to claim the MHRTC on her 2023 return. Her qualifying expenditures are $70,000.</p>
<p>Even though Jackie paid $70,000 for expenses, only the maximum of $50,000 can be claimed:</span></p>

</ul>
	   <p>When Jackie calculated her taxes before including the MHRTC, she had a balance owing of $2,000. With the maximum MHRTC applied, she will receive a refund of $5,500.</p>
	   
	   <h3>If you have more than one qualifying renovation in a year</h3>
	   <p>If  you complete two qualifying renovations for two separate qualifying individuals, you can calculate and claim the MHRTC for each one.</p>
	   <details><summary>Example: Completing two qualifying renovations in the same year</summary>
		   <p>Des is related to three qualifying individuals: her brother, her mother, and her father. </p>
<p>In April 2023, she renovated her house to create a self-contained basement apartment so her brother could move in with her. This renovation was completed in October 2023. Her qualifying expenses for this renovation were <strong>$15,000</strong>.</p>

<p>In July 2023, Des decided to build a second separate apartment over the garage for her elderly parents to move into. This renovation was completed in December 2023. Her qualifying expenses for this renovation were <strong>$63,000</strong>.</p>
<p>As long as both renovations meet the eligibility criteria, Des may claim the expenses for <strong>both</strong> qualifying renovations on her 2023 tax return. The claims must be calculated separately to determine the maximum amount for each:</p>

	   <h2>Splitting the credit between eligible individuals</h2>
	   <p>When more than one individual incurs expenses for the same qualifying renovation, the credit may be shared as long as <strong>all</strong> of the following conditions are met:
	   <ul><li>Each person claiming the MHRTC is an <strong>eligible individual</strong>
	   	<p>
			Refer to: <a href="who.html">Who can claim</a></p></li>
			   <li>The <strong>total</strong> amount claimed between all eligible individuals is <strong>not</strong> more than the maximum</li>
			   <li>The eligible individuals claim only qualifying expenditures that they incurred</li>
		   <li>No MHRTC has previously been claimed for the <strong>qualifying individual</strong> (the person 65 years of age or older, or adult who qualifies for the disability tax credit)</li>
	   </ul>
	   
	   <details>
		   <summary>Example: Splitting the maximum credit between two eligible individuals</summary>
<p>Rey and Jax shared the cost of a qualifying renovation in 2023. Both Rey and Jax are eligible individuals and may claim their portion of the qualifying expenses on their returns.</p>
		   <p>The total amount of qualifying expenses Rey and Jax incurred for the renovation was $62,000.</p>
<p>Rey’s qualifying expenses were $29,000.</p>
<p>Jax’s qualifying expenses were $33,000.</p>
<p>Because the maximum amount of expenses that can be claimed for the MHRTC is $50,000, Rey and Jax will split the credit according to the portion of expenses each of them incurred.</p>
		   <p><strong>Rey's claim:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Rey’s portion of maximum claim: $29,000 &divide; $62, 000 &equals; 47%</li>
	<li>Amount of expenses Rey will claim: $50,000 &times; 47% &equals; <strong>$23,500</strong></li>

<p><strong>Jax's claim:</strong></p><li>Jax’s portion of maximum claim: $33,000 &divide; $62, 000 &equals; 53%</li>
