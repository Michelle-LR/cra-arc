	<li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span> A reasonable expense that is directly attributable to the qualifying renovation of an eligible dwelling</li>

	<p>
	Refer to: <a href="who-ctestmaire.html">Who can claim</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A qualifying expenditure <strong>may include</strong>:</p>
<ul class="fa-ul">
<li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span> Goods acquired or services received, including work performed by professionals (such as electricians, plumbers, carpenters or architects)</p>

	<p>Qualifying expenditures can also include an outlay or expense made or incurred by a trust that an eligible individual is a beneficiary to if the expense is reasonably attributable to the eligible dwelling.</p>
<p>
For this rule to apply the outlay or expense must be a qualifying expenditure of the eligible individual, if it had been made or incurred by that individual, and the trust must notify that individual of the amount of the outlay or expense attributable to the eligible dwelling.

            <h2 id="h-2">Expenses that do not qualify</h2>

    
        <p>Expenses that do <strong>not</strong> qualify include:</p>
<ul class="fa-ul">
<li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span>Annual, recurring, or routine repair or maintenance</li>
<li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span>Household appliances</li>

<li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span>Financing costs in respect of the qualifying renovation</li>
<li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span>Goods or services provided by a person <strong>not</strong> dealing at arm’s length with the individual <strong>unless</strong> that person is registered for Goods and Services Tax/Harmonized Sales Tax (GST/HST) under the Excise Tax Act


<li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span>Expenses that can reasonably be considered to have been reimbursed</li>
<li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span>Expenses not supported by receipts</li>
<li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span>Expenses that have already been claimed under the medical expense tax credit and/or home accessibility tax credit</li>
</ul>

  <h2 id="h-3">Maximum amount of expenses you can claim</h2>
<p>An eligible individual can claim up to $50,000 in qualifying costs for one qualifying renovation that was completed in the tax year. When renovation costs have been shared, more than one eligible individual can each make a claim for the same renovation up to a combined total of $50,000.</p>
		 <p>The MHRTC is 15% of <strong>whichever amount is less</strong>:</p>
 <ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or">
  <li class="cnjnctn-col">
    <p>$50,000</p>
  </li>
  <li class="cnjnctn-col">
    <p>The amount of qualifying expenditures incurred by the eligible individual</p>
	
	 </li> </ul>
	 <p>Since this tax credit is refundable, you will receive a refund if the credit you claim is <strong>more</strong> than the taxes you owe.</p>
	 
		 <h3>Example: Claiming the maximum amount of the MHRTC</h3>
		 <p>Jackie is eligible to claim the MHRTC on her 2023 return. Her qualifying expenditures are $70,000.</p>
<p>Even though Jackie paid $70,000 for expenses, only the maximum of $50,000 can be claimed:</span></p>

</ul>
	   <p>When Jackie calculated her taxes before including the MHRTC, she had a balance owing of $2,000. With the maximum MHRTC applied, she will receive a refund of $5,500.</p>
	   

     <h2 id="h-4">Claims for more than one qualifying renovation in a year</h2>
	   <p>If  you complete 2 qualifying renovations for 2 separate qualifying individuals, you can calculate and claim the MHRTC for each one.</p>
	   <details><summary>Example: Completing 2 qualifying renovations in the same year</summary>
		   <p>Des is related to three qualifying individuals: her brother, her mother, and her father. </p>
<p>In April 2023, she renovated her house to create a self-contained basement apartment so her brother could move in with her. This renovation was completed in October 2023. Her qualifying expenses for this renovation were <strong>$15,000</strong>.</p>

<p>In July 2023, Des decided to build a second separate apartment over the garage for her elderly parents to move into. This renovation was completed in December 2023. Her qualifying expenses for this renovation were <strong>$63,000</strong>.</p>
<p>As long as both renovations meet the eligibility criteria, Des may claim the expenses for <strong>both</strong> qualifying renovations on her 2023 tax return. Although Des spent $78,000 on the renovations to create 2 secondary units, she is limited to the maximum per qualifying renovation and cannot combine her total qualifying expenditures. The claims must be calculated separately to determine the maximum amount for each:</p>
