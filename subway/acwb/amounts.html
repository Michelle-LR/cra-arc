            <p>The amount you can expect to receive for the Canada workers benefit (CWB) depends on <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/canada-workers-benefit/net-income-not-eligible.html">your income and your province or territory of residence</a>.</p>

            </ul>
            <h2 id="h-1">Basic benefit maximum amount</h2>
            <p>The maximum basic amount for the CWB is:</p>
            <ul>
	<li> 
            
		<p><strong>$1,428 for single individuals</strong></p>
		    <p>The amount is gradually reduced if your adjusted net income is more than $23,495. No basic amount is paid if your adjusted net income is more than $33,015.</p></li>
		    <li><p><strong>$2,461 for families</strong></p>
		    <p>The amount is gradually reduced if your adjusted family net income is more than $26,805. No basic amount is paid if your adjusted family net income is more than $43,212.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>The maximum basic CWB amount will vary for residents of Quebec, Nunavut and Alberta.
         
		 
            <h2 id="h-2">Disability supplement maximum amount</h2>
            <p>The maximum amount for the disability supplement is:</p>
		 <ul>
			 <li><p><strong>$737 for single individuals</strong></p>
			 <p>The CWB disability supplement is gradually reduced if your adjusted net income is more than $33,018. No disability supplement is paid if your adjusted net income is more than $37,932.</p></li>
			 <li><p><strong>$737 for families</strong></p>
				 <p>The CWB disability supplement is gradually reduced if your adjusted family net income is more than $43,210. No disability supplement is paid if one spouse is eligible for the disability tax credit and your adjusted family net income is more than $48,124, or if both spouses are eligible for the disability tax credit and your adjusted family net income is more than $53,037.</p></li>
		 </ul>
			 <p>The maximum amount for the disability supplement will vary for residents of Quebec and Nunavut.
		 
		 
            <h2 id="h-3">How we calculate your CWB payment amount</h2>
            <p>The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) uses all of the following information to calculate your CWB:</p>
		 <ul>
			 <li>marital status - <a href="eligible.html#h-1-1">eligible spouse</a></li>
			 <li>province or territory of residence</li>
			 <li>earned working income</li>
			 <li>adjusted family net income</li>
			 <li><a href="eligible.html#h-1-1-1">eligible dependant</a></li>
			 <li>eligibility for the disability tax credit</li>
		 </ul>
		 
		 <h2 id="h-4">Calculating your advanced payments</h2>
            <p>The Advanced Canada workers benefit (ACWB) will always be equal to 50% of your CWB that was calculated on your income tax and benefit return.</p>
<p>You can estimate your ACWB payments by using the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/child-family-benefits-calculator.html">child and family benefit calculator</a>. Note: you must enter the information based on your situation as of December 31 provided on your income tax and benefit return.</p>
		 <p>A change in the eligibility which occurs during a quarter will not impact the ACWB payment amount for the current quarter.</p>
		
		 		 <h2 id="h-5">How we determine the recipient for married or common-law spouses</h2>
		 <p>Only one spouse will receive the ACWB payment.</p>

		 
		 <h3>When neither spouse is entitled to a disability supplement</h3>
		 <p>For couples, the ACWB basic amount is sent to the spouse with the higher working income. If both spouses have the same working income, the ACWB basic amount is paid to the first filer.</p>
		 
		 <h3>When one or both spouses is entitled to receive the disability supplement</h3>
		 <p>If you and your spouse are both eligible for the ACWB and one of you is also eligible for the disability tax credit, the person with the disability will receive the basic amount for the family and their disability supplement payment.</p>
		 <p>If you and your spouse are both eligible for the ACWB and the disability tax credit, only one of you will receive the basic amount for the family. However, each of you will receive your own disability supplement.</p>
		 
		 		 		 <h2 id="h-6">Advanced payment dates for the Canada workers benefit</h2>
		 <p>The ACWB is issued in 3 quarterly payments on the 12 of July, October, and January.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
                        <h4>Payment dates for this year</h4>

                  </div>		 <p>When the issuance date falls on a Saturday, a Sunday, or a federal statutory holiday, the payment will be made on the last business day prior to the issuance date.</p>
