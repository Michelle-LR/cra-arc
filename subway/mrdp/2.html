  <p>If you are only buying products or services using  digital platforms (not selling or facilitating sales), the new requirements do <strong>not</strong> apply to you. You do not have to share, report, or file anything. Your browsing  and buying information is also <strong>not</strong> shared with the CRA.</p>

        <p>If you are a seller of products or services, the rules apply to you if you are considered to be a reportable seller.</p>
        <p>A <strong>reportable seller</strong> is <strong>all</strong> of the following:</p>
        <ul class="fa-ul">
          <li><span class="fas fa-check text-muted fa-li"></span>An individual  or entity that is an active seller
            <details>
              <summary>What is an active seller</summary>
              <p>The seller must have provided relevant services or sold goods during the  reportable period (calendar year) or has been paid or credited compensation in  connection with relevant activities during the reportable period. </p>

          <li><span class="fas fa-check text-muted fa-li"></span>Has been  determined by a reporting platform operator to be <strong>one</strong> of the following:  
            <ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or">
              <li class="cnjnctn-col">Be resident in a reportable jurisdiction</li>
              <li class="cnjnctn-col">Have provided relevant services for the rental of real or  immovable property located in a reportable jurisdiction </li>
              <li class="cnjnctn-col">Have been paid or credited consideration in connection with  relevant services for the rental of real or immovable property located in a  reportable jurisdiction</li>
            </ul>
            <details>
              <summary>What is a platform operator </summary>
              <p>Under the new  requirements, a platform operator is someone who contracts with sellers to make  all or part of a platform (for example (for example, software such as a website  or application) available to them to connect with buyers. For the new rules to  apply , the platform must enable the provision of specific supplies (referred  to as relevant activities) and must include the collection and payment of  consideration in respect of those supplies.</p>
              <p>Software that exclusively allows for the following  activities is <strong>not </strong>considered a platform under the rules: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>the processing of payments</li>
                <li>listing or advertising</li>
                <li>redirecting or transferring of users to  another platform </li>
              </ul>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary>What is a reportable jurisdiction </summary>
              <p>A reportable  jurisdiction depends on the jurisdiction of residence of the reporting platform  operator. If the platform operator is resident in Canada, then Canada and any  partner jurisdiction is a reportable jurisdiction. This means the platform  operator is required to report to Canada information about the following: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>sellers resident in Canada</li>
                <li>sellers resident in any partner jurisdiction </li>
                <li>sellers renting immovable property located in Canada or  any partner jurisdiction</li>
              </ul>
              <p>In any other case,  only Canada is a reportable jurisdiction. This means that such a platform  operator (for example, a platform operator resident outside Canada) would be  required to report to Canada only information about sellers resident in Canada  and sellers renting immovable property located in Canada. </p>

        <p>If you are a seller of products or services, the rules do <strong>not</strong> apply to you if you are considered to be an excluded seller.</p>
        <p>An <strong>excluded seller </strong>is <strong>one</strong> of the following: </p>
