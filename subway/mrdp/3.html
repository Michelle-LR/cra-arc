  <p>If you are only buying products or services using  digital platforms (not selling or facilitating sales), the new requirements do <strong>not</strong> apply to you. You do not have to share, report, or file anything. Your browsing  and buying information is also <strong>not</strong> shared with the CRA.</p>
  <h2 id="seller"><img src="images/seller.jpg" alt="">Sellers of products or services</h2>
  <p>If you are a seller of products or services who is  considered to be a <a href="2.html#reportable-seller">reportable  seller</a>, your information will be collected by the platform and reported to the CRA.  This information is referred to as <strong>reportable elements</strong>.</p>

  <p>These digital platforms will provide you with a copy of  the annual information that is collected and reported under these rules by  January 31 of each year.  </p>
  <p>The  information reported to the CRA may be shared with tax authorities in other jurisdictions that  have adopted similar rules. In addition, the CRA will receive information about  Canadian sellers or rental property located in Canada from other jurisdictions  that have implemented similar reporting rules as Canada for platforms operating  in their jurisdiction. </p>
  <p>For more information about the reportable elements,  refer to:  Chapter 6 of the CRA's <a href="#">Guidance on the Reporting Rules for  Digital Platform Operators</a></p>
  <h3>Expect the platform to ask for your infomation</h3>
  <p>As a result of these rules, digital platforms on which  you are selling may ask you for additional information about you or your  business in order to fulfill their reporting obligations to the CRA.</p>
  <p>
    <mark>[Placeholder for a reminder section about scams and fraud]</mark>
  </p>
  </ul>
  <h3>Consequences for not providing required  information </h3>
  <p>You may face consequences from both your platform  operator(s) and the CRA if you do not provide the required information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If  you do not provide the information your platform operator(s) are required to  report, they can take actions against you like locking your account.</li>
    <li>If  you do not provide your tax identification number to your platform operator(s),  the CRA may assess you a penalty of $500. </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Other tax obligations</h3>
  <p>For more information about your tax obligations as an  online seller, refer to: the CRA&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/compliance/platform-economy.html">Taxes  and the platform economy</a></p>
  <h2 id="operator"><img src="images/operator.JPG" alt="">Digital platform operators</h2>
  <p>If you are a digital platform operator who is  considered to be a <a href="2.html#reportable-platform-operator">reporting  platform operator</a>, you must collect and report the following  information under the rules: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Information  about you (and your businesses):
      <ul>
        <li>Legal name </li>
        <li>Registered office address </li>
        <li>Taxpayer identification number (TIN)
            <details>
            <summary class="max-content">What is a tax identification number</summary>
            <p>Tax  identification number – In Canada, a tax identification number includes a  social insurance number, a business number or an account number issued to a  trust. </p>
          </details></li>
        <li>Business names of all platforms for which  you&rsquo;re reporting</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Identification  and activity information (<a href="#reportable-elements">reportable  elements</a>) about reportable sellers</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You must also provide each reportable seller with a  copy of the annual information  reported  to the CRA about them by January 31 of each year.</p>
  <p>A reporting platform operator <strong>does not have to report the required  information concerning a seller</strong> to the CRA if they have obtained adequate  assurances that: </p>
 <ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and cnjnctn-md">
      <li class="cnjnctn-col">
        <p>Another platform operator has or will fulfil  that reporting obligation according to the rules in Canada </p>
      </li>
      <li class="cnjnctn-col">
        <p>The seller is not resident in Canada, under  substantially similar rules in a partner jurisdiction</p>
      </li>
</ul>
   
   <p>For more details, refer to: CRA's <a href="#">Guidance on the Reporting Rules for Digital Platform Operators</a></li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Due diligence procedures</h3>
  <p>As a reporting platform operator, you must take steps  to verify the accuracy of the information you collect and report under the  rules. </p>
    <p>More specifically, you must verify <strong>all</strong> of the following: </p>
   
  <ul class="fa-ul">
    <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span> excluded  sellers</li>
    <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span> the  reliability of seller information</li>
    <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span> in  the case of rental property, verify the address of each property listing  </li>
  </ul>
  <p>These  steps must be completed by December 31 of the reportable period to which they  relate, except for transitional periods (i.e. the first year a platform  operator is considered a reporting platform operator under the rules). </p>
  <p>For more information about due diligence procedures, refer to: Chapter 5 of the CRA's <a href="#">Guidance on the Reporting Rules for Digital Platform Operators</a></p>
