 <p>The information on this page replaces the information in Guide RC4160, Rebate for Tour Packages, Foreign Conventions, and Non-Resident Exhibitor Purchases, and as a result, this guide has been eliminated.</p>
 <p>A GST/HST rebate is no longer available to non-residents for the Canadian accommodation portion of eligible tour packages under the Foreign Convention and Tour Incentive Program (FCTIP) if the tour packages or accommodations are supplied after March 22, 2017. However, the rebate may still be available in respect of a supply of a tour package or accommodations made after March 22, 2017, and before 2018 if the amount owing for the supply is paid in full before January 1, 2018.</p>
	<p>The rebate will still available in respect of a supply of a tour package or accommodation made on or before March 22, 2017, regardless of when the consideration for the supply is paid or the tour takes place.</p>
	<p>In addition, a rebate under the FCTIP is still available for certain expenses related to foreign conventions.</p>
	<p>As of July 1, 2021, digital economy businesses, including digital platform operators, may have potential goods and services tax/harmonized sales tax (GST/HST) obligations under three new measures that were announced in the Fall Economic Statement 2020 by the Government of Canada and revised as announced on April 19, 2021 following consultations with stakeholders. This means you may have new obligations, including registering, charging, collecting and reporting the GST/HST.</p>
		   <p>For more information on these new measures and the definitions for the digital economy go to <a href="">GST/HST for digital economy businesses: Overview</a>.</p>

        <h3 id="typeinfo">Information required on supporting documents</h3>
<p>Supporting documents must show that the <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> paid the GST/HST on the supply of <span class="nowrap">short-term</span> or camping accommodation, or the eligible tour package, as the case may be. An invoice that shows only the tax payable (not paid) is not sufficient.</p>
<p>Supporting documents must show that the packages were tour packages supplied to <span class="nowrap">non-residents</span> or by a tour operator, as the case may be, for an <span class="nowrap">all-inclusive</span> price, and that the packages included <span class="nowrap">short-term</span> and/or camping accommodation in Canada and at least one service. In addition, supporting documents must specify the number of nights of <span class="nowrap">short-term</span> and/or camping accommodation in Canada included in each package.</p>
<p>The information showing that&nbsp;a tour operator has met the eligibility requirements does not have to be on separate documents. One or two documents may contain all the required information. In addition, electronic documents that can be reproduced on paper are acceptable.</p>
<p>The CRA will also accept documents prepared by <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span>, <span class="nowrap">non-registered</span> tour operators (in other words, reverse invoicing), as long as the documents include the information that would be found on the original invoices or receipts prepared by the registrant supplier. These documents must include the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>the supplier’s name, address, telephone number and business number</li>
<li>the recipient’s name, address and telephone number</li>
<li>details about the supply, such as a description of the accommodation, the number of nights and consideration</li>
<li>the GST/HST charged</li>
<li>proof that the amount was paid (for example, a copy of a&nbsp;cancelled cheque or wire payment confirmation number)</li>
</ul>

        <h3>Tour operator records</h3>
<p>If you are a tour operator, you must also keep <strong>all </strong>of the following documents in your records and make them available if the CRA asks&nbsp;to see them:</p>
<ul>
<li>a list of&nbsp;names and addresses of the <span class="nowrap">non-residents</span> who bought your tour packages</li>
<li>a list of&nbsp;names and addresses of the <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> individuals who stayed in the accommodation</li>
<li>the names of the agents through whom you sold the tour packages (if applicable)</li>
<li>copies of the original invoices issued to your clients</li>

<ul>
<li>a non-resident tour operator that is not registered for the GST/HST</li>

<p>Under the GST/HST rulings service, tour operators may ask for a ruling on whether a tour&nbsp;is an&nbsp;eligible tour package under the FCTIP. This rulings service gives tour operators certainty on whether they are supplying eligible tour packages, and makes it easier for them to receive their GST/HST rebates under the FCTIP in&nbsp;a timely fashion.&nbsp;For more information, see <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/notice273.html">Notice 273 GST/HST Rulings Service – Eligibility of Tours under the Foreign Convention and Tour Incentive Program</a>.</p>
