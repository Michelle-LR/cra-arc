               <h2>Tax season starts February 19, and here’s what you need to know</h2>
               <p>Many Canadians are trying their best to save money, reduce expenses, and make their budgets last longer. This year, you can start filing your tax and benefit return as of February 19, 2024. By doing so, you may be entitled to a refund or qualify for certain benefits and credits. <p>
<p>As a reminder, it is by filing your tax returns every year that the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) determines your eligibility for a refund or benefit and credit payments. Qualifying for benefit and credit payments puts money in your pockets. Last year, the average tax refund for Canadians was $XXX. In addition, parents can receive money through the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/canada-child-benefit-overview.html">Canada child benefit</a> (CCB) to help with the cost of raising children younger than 18 years of age. The CCB may include the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/child-disability-benefit.html">child disability benefit</a> and any related <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/provincial-territorial-programs.html">provincial and territorial programs</a>. Don’t miss out!</p>
<p>Here is what you need to know, how to prepare, and what's new this tax season.</p>
<h2>Key dates</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>February 19, 2024</strong> –  This is the first day when you can start filing your 2023 tax return <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-individuals/netfile-overview.html">online</a>. If you <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/campaigns/income-tax-benefit-return-paper.html">file on paper</a>, you should receive your income tax package in the mail by this date.</li>
  <li><strong>April 30, 2024</strong> – This is the deadline to file a tax return for most Canadians and if you owe money to the CRA this is also the deadline.</li>
  <li><strong>June 15, 2024 </strong> – If you or your spouse or common-law partner are self-employed, this is the deadline to file your tax returns. As this date falls on a Saturday, your return will be considered filed on time if the CRA receives it or it is postmarked on or before <strong>June 17, 2024</strong>. If you owe money to the CRA, you'll still need to pay by <strong>April 30, 2024</strong>, to avoid interest.</li>
</ul>
