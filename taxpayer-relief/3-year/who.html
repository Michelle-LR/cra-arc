			<p> The purpose for requesting an adjustment beyond the normal three-year period can not be to dispute how correct or valid a previous assessment is.</p>
                    <p>The CRA will not allow an adjustment beyond the normal three-year period when the individual or graduated rate estate chose not to dispute the issues through the normal objection or appeal process. For example, an audit reassessment, or where the issues were already dealt with under the objection process.

                    <p>The CRA will generally not accept a request for an adjustment beyond the normal three-year period to the income tax return of another individual. For example, if the adjustment would result in the increase of one of the following:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>taxes</li>
					<li>interest</li></ul>
			<p>
		<p>The CRA cannot reassess penalties on the income tax return of another individual when the time limit for objecting to, or requesting relief from, has already passed (statute-barred).</p>
                </details>
		</li>
			<li>
			<details>
				<summary>Provincial benefits or credits</summary>
				<p>The legislation that allows the CRA the discretion to refund or reduce the amount payable beyond the normal three-year period does not override provincial limitations, unless it is indicated in the provincial act. For example, if there are time limits to claim certain provincial benefits or credits (that the CRA administers on behalf of the provinces).</p>
			</details>
				</li>
		<li>
		<details>		
			<summary>Permissive deductions</summary>
			<p>The CRA will not process requests for adjustments when the taxpayer originally claimed less than the maximum amount allowed. For example, if the requested decrease in tax is the result of an increased claim for capital cost allowance or other allowable deductions. For more information, see <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/ic84-1/revision-capital-cost-allowance-claims-other-permissive-deductions.html">Information Circular IC84-1, Revision of Capital Cost Allowance Claims and Other Permissive Deductions</a>.</p>

				<li>Canada Pension Plan (CPP) contributions</li></ul>	
					<div class="alert alert-info">

				<details>
					<summary>Requests based on a court decision or other resolution</summary>
					<p>If the request is made as a result of a court decision, the CRA will generally not allow for the reassessment of a return beyond the normal three-year period. Requests made to reassess a return beyond the normal three-year period based only on the successful appeal by another taxpayer will not be granted. For more information, see <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/ic75-7.html"> Information Circular IC75-7R3, Reassessment of a Return of Income</a>.</p>
<p>Similarly, knowledge of another taxpayer's negotiated settlement to resolve an objection, or another taxpayer's consent to judgment on an appeal, will generally not be allowed an adjustment beyond the normal three-year period if the taxpayer has chosen not to protect his or her right of objection or appeal.</p>
