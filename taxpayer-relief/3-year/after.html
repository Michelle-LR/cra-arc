<p>In all cases, once we have finished our review, we will notify you, in writing, of our decision. Your request may be approved, partially approved, or denied. If your request is partially approved or denied, our letter will advise you on what you can do if you do not agree with our decision.</p>

			<h2 id="h-1">If your request is approved</h2>
			<p>Depending on your particular situation, any of the following may happen if your request is approved:</p>
			<ul class="list-unstyled">
			<li>
				<details>
					<summary>Refund</summary>
					<p>You may receive a refund of your overpayment of tax as a result of the reassessment ore redetermination.</p> 
				</details>
			</li>
			<li>
				<details>
					<summary>Reduce the amount of your refund</summary>
					<p>The CRA may reduce the amount of your refund if the adjustment results in an increase of taxes, interest, or penalties. Under these circumstances, the CRA will usually only issue a refund for the amount that exceeds the taxes, interest, and penalties and apply the remainder to the new debt.</p>
					<p>If your Canada Child Benefit (CCB), Canada Child Tax Benefit (CCTB), or goods and services tax/harmonized sales tax (GSH/HST) results in you having overpayments, your refund may be reduced accordingly.</p> 
				</details>
			</li>
			<li>
				<details>
					<summary>Refund interest</summary>
					<p>You are entitled to a refund if your request results in a reassessment or redetermination that either:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>cancels all or part of any penalty or interest that you already paid</li>
						<li>reduces the amount of tax you owed</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
					<p>Refund interest is compounded daily at the prescribed rates starting on the 31st day after your request was received in full. If your request was received by filing an income tax return, refund interest will start on the 31st day after the date the return was filed.</p>
					<p>There is no interest paid on a refund for GST/HST credits, CCTB, or CCB payments made to an individual.</p>
				</details>
			</li>
			<li>
				<details>
					<summary>Applying your refund to other debts</summary>
					<p>Your refund may be applied to any other amount you owe, or are about to owe.</p>
					<div class="alert alert-info">
            <p><strong>Exception</strong></p>
				<p>Any refund you are expecting from CCTB or CCB, will not be held and applied to any other debts you owe.</p>

			</li>
			<li>
				<details>
					<summary>Refund held until outstanding returns are filed</summary>

		<ul class="fa-ul">
<li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span> The reasons why you disagree with the CRA's decision, for example, not all information was considered, certain facts or details were missing, misinterpreted, or not considered in their proper context</li>
			<li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span> Any relevant new documents, facts, or correspondence</li>
		</ul><p>
<p>In order for the CRA to remain impartial and transparent, the official who completed the first review will not conduct the second review.</p>
<p>The CRA may still uphold its previous decision following a second review of your request for relief.</p>
			<p>
<h3>Judicial review</h3>
<p>If, after the second review, you still feel that we were not fair and reasonable, you can apply to the Federal Court for a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/complaints-disputes/judicial-review.html">judicial review</a> of our decision. You must do this within 30 calendar days of the date you received the decision from the second administrative review.</p>
