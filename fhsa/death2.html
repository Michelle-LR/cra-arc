        <h2><a id="h_2"></a>Types of beneficiaries</h2>
<p>After the death of the holder, the possible tax consequences will vary depending on the type of beneficiary and whether there is an <a href="#excessfhsa" aria-controls="excessfhsa" class="wb-lbx" role="button">excess FHSA amount&nbsp;<span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a> at the time of death.</p>
<p>The types of beneficiaries of an FHSA who can be designated in the FHSA contract or the deceased holder’s will are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#h_3_1">A survivor who has been designated as the successor holder and is a qualifying individual</a></li>
<li><a href="#h_3_2">A survivor who has been designated as the successor holder but is not a qualifying individual</a></li>
<li><a href="#h_3_3">A survivor who has been designated as a beneficiary but not as the successor holder</a></li>
<li><a href="#h_4">Beneficiaries other than survivors</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Determining the type of beneficiary is the first important step.</p>
<p>The type of beneficiary will depend on:</p>
<ul>
<li>designations made in the deceased holder’s FHSA contract</li>
<li>designations made in the deceased holder’s will, if there is one</li>
<li>provincial or territorial succession legislation</li>
