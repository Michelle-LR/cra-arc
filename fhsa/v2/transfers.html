            <h2 id="h-2">What is a direct transfer</h2>
	<ul class="fa-ul">
<li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li fa-lg"></span>A <strong>direct transfer</strong> is a transfer completed directly between the financial institutions of the two plans or accounts involved. To complete a direct transfer, you must fill out a transfer form and give it to your financial institution.<ul>
<li>Financial institutions do not have to use the forms referenced <strong>on this page</strong>. The institution that transfers your amounts may use other types of documents to record the transfer. The institution has to provide you with confirmation of the details of the transfer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li fa-lg"></span>In order to make a direct transfer, <strong>you must not withdraw the property yourself</strong> and contribute it to another one of your plans or accounts. Those transactions would <strong>not</strong> be considered a direct transfer. In that case, the amount that you withdraw from your FHSA will be a taxable withdrawal, which you must report as income when you file your income tax and benefit return for the year of the withdrawal. There may also be other unintended tax consequences for your other plans and accounts.</li>

<p>Since it was <strong>not</strong> a direct transfer between Lito’s FHSAs, the $2,100 that he withdrew from his FHSA with <span class="nowrap">Bank A</span> would be a taxable withdrawal. Lito must report $2,100 as income when he files his 2023 income tax and benefit return.</p>

	<p>You will be allowed to transfer property from your FHSAs to your RRSPs or RRIFs without any immediate tax consequences, as long as it is a <strong>direct transfer</strong> and you do not have an excess FHSA amount.</p>
<p>Generally, an amount that is transferred directly from your FHSAs to your RRSPs or RRIFs will not impact your unused RRSP deduction room or your unused FHSA participation room.</p>
<p>If you do not do a direct transfer, the amount you withdraw from your FHSA would be a taxable withdrawal and would be treated as a new RRSP contribution. That new contribution would reduce your unused RRSP deduction room and could result in RRSP excess contributions in certain cases.</p>
		 <p>To complete a direct transfer from your FHSAs to your RRSPs or RRIFs, you must fill out a transfer form and give it to your financial institution.&nbsp;<span class="label label-info">This form will be available at a later date.</span></p>

        <p>Anthony opened his FHSA in 2023. Over the years, he contributed the maximum amount to his FHSA, reaching his lifetime FHSA limit of $40,000 in 2027. It is now 2038, and Anthony must close his account by <span class="nowrap">December 31, 2038</span>, since it will reach the <a href="#maxpart" aria-controls="maxpart" class="wb-lbx" role="button">maximum participation period&nbsp;<span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a> of fifteen years on that date. Anthony does not have an excess FHSA amount.</p>
<p>Anthony fills out the transfer form and asks his financial institution to do a direct transfer of all the property in his FHSA to his RRSP and to close his FHSA once the property has been transferred.</p>
<ul class="fa-ul">
<li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li fa-lg"></span>Since it is direct transfer and Anthony has no excess FHSA amount, there are no tax consequences and there will be no impact on his unused RRSP deduction room.</li>
