           <p>A withdrawal from an FHSA is not required to be included in your income if it is:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><h3>A qualifying withdrawal</h3>
<p>when you withdraw from your FHSA to buy a home and meet all the conditions for a qualifying withdrawal</p>
</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><h3>A designated amount</h3>
<p>when you withdraw or transfer from your FHSA because you contributed or transferred too much and have an excess amount</p>
</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">an amount otherwise included in your income</li>
</ul>
<p>In all other cases, the amount withdrawn from your FHSA is a taxable withdrawal and must be included as income on your income tax and benefit return for the year the withdrawal is received.</p>
<p>If you transfer property <strong>directly</strong> from your FHSA to another FHSA, a <a href="#rrsp" aria-controls="rrsp" class="wb-lbx" role="button">registered retirement savin<span class="nowrap">g</span> plan (RRSP<span class="nowrap">)&nbsp;</span><span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a>, or a <a href="#rrif" aria-controls="rrif" class="wb-lbx" role="button">registered retirement income fund (RRIF)&nbsp;<span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a>, this is a transfer and not a withdrawal.

            <h2 id="h-2">Making qualifying withdrawals from your FHSAs</h2>
           <p>If you meet the qualifying withdrawal conditions, you can withdraw all of the property from your FHSAs tax-free. You can do this either in a single withdrawal or a series of withdrawals.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There is no minimum number of days that contributions or transfers to your FHSAs must stay in your FHSAs before you can use them for a qualifying withdrawal. You can withdraw amounts from your RRSP under the Home Buyers’ <span class="nowrap">Plan (HBP)</span> <strong>and</strong> make a qualifying withdrawal from your FHSA for the same qualifying home, as long as you meet all of the conditions at the time of each withdrawal. For information about the HBP conditions, go&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/rrsps-related-plans/what-home-buyers-plan/participate-home-buyers-plan.html">How to participate in the Home Buyers’ Plan (HBP)</a>.</p>

		 <p>A qualifying withdrawal is a withdrawal from your FHSA where <strong>all</strong> of the following conditions are met:</p>
<ul>
<li>you must fill out Form <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc725.html">RC725,&nbsp;Request to Make a Qualifying Withdrawal from your FHSA</a> and give it to your FHSA&nbsp;<a href="#issuer" aria-controls="issuer" class="wb-lbx" role="button">issuer&nbsp;<span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a>.</li>

<li>you must have a written agreement to buy or build a <a href="#qualhome" aria-controls="qualhome" class="wb-lbx" role="button">qualifying home&nbsp;<span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a>&nbsp;with the <strong>acquisition or construction completion date</strong> of the qualifying home <strong>before <span class="nowrap">October 1</span></strong> of the year following the date of the withdrawal</li>
<li>you must not have acquired the qualifying home more than <span class="nowrap">30 days</span> before making the withdrawal</li>
<li>you must be a resident of Canada from the time that you make your first qualifying withdrawal from one of your FHSAs until the earlier of the acquisition of the qualifying home, or the date of your death</li>
<li>you must occupy or intend to occupy the qualifying home as your principal place of residence <strong>within one year</strong> after buying or building it</li>

<p>In all other cases, an amount withdrawn from your FHSAs must be included as income on your income tax and benefit return for the year the withdrawal is received.

<p>If you have an excess FHSA amount, one of the ways that you can reduce or eliminate your excess FHSA amount is to make a designated withdrawal.
