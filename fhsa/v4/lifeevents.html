<p>If you become a non-resident of Canada after you open your FHSA, you can continue to participate normally in your FHSA, with one exception:</p>

<p>One of the requirements of a qualifying withdrawal is that you must be a resident of Canada throughout the period that begins with the date of the first qualifying withdrawal and ends with the date of acquisition of the qualifying home.</p>
<p>If you are a non-resident of Canada, any taxable withdrawal from your FHSA will be subject to withholding tax in the year of withdrawal.</p>

<div class="mwsalerts section">

  <h2 id="h-2">Transferring amounts on the breakdown of a marriage or common-law partnership</h2>
<p>In general, you are not permitted to transfer property from your FHSAs to your current or former spouse or common-law partner without tax consequences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, there will be no immediate tax consequences if you make a direct transfer from your FHSAs to an FHSA, <a href="#rrsp" aria-controls="rrsp" class="wb-lbx" role="button">registered retirement savings plan (RRSP)&nbsp;<span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a>, or&nbsp;<a href="#rrif" aria-controls="rrif" class="wb-lbx" role="button">registered retirement income fund (RRIF)&nbsp;<span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a> of your current or former spouse or common-law partner, and <strong>both</strong>&nbsp;of the following conditions are met:</p>

<li class="cnjnctn-col">The maximum amount you transfer to your current or former spouse or common-law partner’s FHSAs, RRSPs, or RRIFs is:<ul class="fa-ul lst-spcd mrgn-bttm-lg mrgn-lft-lg">

<li class="cnjnctn-col">have to be included as income on your income tax and benefit return for the year of the transfer</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">be treated as a new contribution to your current or former spouse’s or common-law partner’s FHSAs or RRSPs</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">reduce your current or former spouse’s or common-law partner’s unused FHSA participation room or unused RRSP deduction room, and could result in an excess FHSA amount or RRSP excess contributions in certain cases</li>

        <p>Property transferred on the breakdown of your marriage or common-law partnership to your current or former spouse’s or common-law partner’s RRSPs or RRIFs from your FHSAs will be subject to the usual rules applicable to RRSPs and RRIFs. When amounts are later withdrawn from the RRSPs or RRIFs, the amounts withdrawn must be included as income in the year received on your current or former spouse’s or common-law partner’s income tax and benefit return.

<p>In order to directly transfer property on the breakdown of your marriage or common-law partnership from your FHSAs to your current or former spouse’s or common-law partner’s FHSAs, RRSPs or RRIFs, you will need to fill out a transfer form and provide it to your FHSA&nbsp;<a href="#issuer" aria-controls="issuer" class="wb-lbx" role="button">issuer&nbsp;<span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a>. <span class="label label-info">More information about the transfer form will be available at a later date.</span></p>
<p>You must not withdraw the property from your FHSAs yourself and give it to your current or former spouse or common-law partner. This transaction would not be considered a direct transfer and will have immediate tax consequences.</p>
<p>If you withdraw the property from your FHSAs yourself, the amount that you withdraw from your FHSA would be a taxable withdrawal, which you must report as income when you file your income tax and benefit return for the year of the withdrawal.</p>

        <p>Jordan and Kinsley divorced in 2023. By order of a competent tribunal, Jordan must pay 50% of the FMV of his FHSA to Kinsley. At the time of the transfer, Jordan’s FHSA had a FMV of $6,000. Both Jordan and Kinsley have existing FHSAs and Jordan did not have an excess FHSA amount at the time of the transfer.</p>
<p>Jordan filled out the transfer form from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) web page and gave it to his FHSA issuer. His FHSA issuer directly transferred $3,000 to Kinsley’s FHSA.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Phil and Claire separated in 2023. According to their written separation agreement, Claire is entitled to receive 50% of the FMV of Phil’s FHSA. The agreement did not specify where Claire must put the money she will receive from Phil’s FHSA.</p>
<p>When they separated, Phil’s FHSA had an FMV of $8,000. Both Phil and Claire have existing FHSAs and neither of them had an excess FHSA amount at the time of the transfer.</p>
<p>Instead of the amount being directly transferred from Phil’s FHSA to a registered plan of her own, Claire opts to receive the $4,000 settlement amount in cash. Phil makes a withdrawal of $4,000 from his FHSA on December 2, 2023, and gives $4,000 to Claire. Claire then decides to contribute $2,000 to her FHSA and $1,500 to her RRSP on December 7, 2023. Claire uses the remaining $500 for her upcoming vacation.</p>
<p>As the $4,000 was withdrawn from Phil’s FHSA, it is treated as a taxable withdrawal. Phil must include $4,000 as income on his income tax and benefit return for 2023.</p>
<p>The $2,000 contribution to Claire’s FHSA is a new contribution that will reduce her unused FHSA participation room. Likewise, the $1,500 that Claire decided to put in her RRSP is a new RRSP contribution, which will reduce her unused RRSP deduction room.</p>

<p>No contributions or transfers can be made to a deceased holder’s FHSAs after their date of death.
Also, transfers cannot be made between the deceased holder’s FHSA and their other registered accounts.</p>
	<p>Distributions from the deceased holder's FHSAs can only be made to (or on behalf of) designated beneficiaries. If no beneficiaries have been designated, the amounts from the FHSA will be paid to the estate.</p>
<p>Generally, the deceased holder is not required to include any amounts held in the FHSAs at the time of their death in their income. Under certain circumstances, however, there may be an inclusion in the income of the deceased holder’s estate.</p>
<p>If the deceased holder had an excess FHSA amount at the time of their death, special rules may apply. <span class="label label-info">Information about these rules will be available at a later date.</span></p>

 <h3>Exempt period after a holder's death</a></h3> 
<p>An exempt period begins when the holder dies and ends on December 31 of the same year, or when the trust ceases to exist, if earlier.</p>

<li><a href="#h_3_1-1">A survivor who has been designated as the successor holder and is a qualifying individual</a></li>

<p>Where there are no designated beneficiaries in the deceased holder’s FHSA contract or in the deceased holder’s will, the amounts from the FHSA will be distributed to the deceased holder’s estate and treated as income of the estate.</p>
<p>However, if you have a beneficial interest in the deceased holder’s estate, you and the legal representative of the deceased holder’s estate may choose to do the following:</p>
<div class="container-fluid"><ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">

<p>You and the legal representative can jointly designate that the transfer is deemed to be made from the FHSA (not the estate) such that the transfer will be tax-deferred with no immediate tax consequences if the normal transfer conditions are met.</p>
</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><h3 class="mrgn-tp-sm text-muted h4">Where amounts were paid from the estate directly to you.<span class="wb-inv">: Option 2</span></h3>
<p>You and the legal representative can jointly designate that the payment is deemed to be made from the FHSA (not the estate) such that the payment will be a taxable distribution to you (not the estate). This deemed payment must be included as income on your income tax and benefit return for the year received.</p>

His wife, Audrey, was a beneficiary of the estate. Horace did not have an excess FHSA amount at the time of his death.</p>
<p>All of the property of Horace’s FHSA was distributed to his estate on August 5, 2023. Horace’s FHSA had an FMV of $8,000 immediately before the distribution occurred.</p>
<p>On September 3, 2023, Audrey and the legal representative of Horace’s estate determined that Audrey was entitled to $3,000 of the FHSA from the estate. They completed a prescribed form and jointly elected to have the $3,000 treated as a deemed transfer from Horace’s FHSA (not from the estate) to Audrey’s RRSP. The transfer was completed on September 7, 2023.</p>
<p>As a result of the joint designation, the $3,000 was treated as a tax-deferred transfer from Horace’s FHSA to Audrey’s RRSP. There were no immediate tax consequences for Audrey.</p>
<p>As a result of the joint designation, Horace’s estate was only required to report $5,000 ($8,000 <strong>minus</strong> $3,000) as its income from the FHSA for 2023.</p>
