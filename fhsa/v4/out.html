            <p>If you are buying or building a qualifying home together with another person, both of you can make a qualifying withdrawal from your <strong>own</strong> FHSAs as long as you <strong>both</strong> meet all the conditions to make a qualifying withdrawal.</p>

 <h4>If you have an excess FHSA amount</h4> 
         <p>If you have an excess FHSA amount at the time of the transfer from your FHSAs to your RRSPs or RRIFs, the maximum amount you can transfer and avoid tax consequences is the total fair market value (FMV) of all the property in your FHSAs <strong>minus</strong> your excess FHSA amount.</p>

<p>Any portion of the amount you transfer that exceeds the total FMV of all the property held in all of your FHSAs at the time of the transfer <strong>minus</strong> your excess FHSA amount at the time of the transfer will be treated as both:</p>
   <ul><li>A taxable withdrawal from your FHSA, which must be included on your income tax and benefit return for the year of the transfer</li>

<p>Property transferred to an RRSP or RRIF from an FHSA will be subject to the usual rules applicable to RRSPs and RRIFs. When amounts are later withdrawn from the RRSPs or RRIFs, the amounts withdrawn must be included as income in the year received on your income tax and benefit return.

     <h3 id="h-3-2">Transfers between your FHSAs</h3>
<p>Generally, you can <strong>directly transfer</strong> property from one of your FHSAs to another of your FHSAs without reducing your FHSA participation room.</p>
                       <p>To complete a direct transfer between your FHSAs, fill out <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc721.html">Form RC721 Transfer from your FHSA to your FHSA, RRSP or RRIF</a> and give it to your financial institution.</p>
<section class="alert alert-info">
  <h3>Financial institutions do not have to use Form RC721.</h3>
  <p>The institution that transfers your amounts may use other types of documents to record the transfer. The institution has to provide you with confirmation of the details of the transfer.</p>
</section>
<p>For more information about direct transfers between your FHSAs, go to <a href="transfersin.html">Transfers between your FHSAs</a>.</p>

 <h3 id="h-3-3">Making designated transfers out of your FHSAs</h3>
<p>If you contribute or transfer to your FHSAs more than your FHSA participation room for the year, you will have an <a href="#excessfhsa" aria-controls="excessfhsa" class="wb-lbx" role="button">excess FHSA&nbsp;amount&nbsp;<span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a>. Generally, you have to pay a tax equal to 1% of the highest excess FHSA amount in the month until the excess FHSA amount is eliminated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have an excess FHSA amount, one of the ways that you can reduce or eliminate it is to make a designated transfer. For more information, go to&nbsp;<a href="toomuch.html">What happens if you contribute or transfer too much to your FHSAs</a>.</p>

   <h2 id="h-4">Reporting withdrawals and transfers out of your FHSAs</h2>
  <p>Your FHSA issuer will give you a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t4fhsa.html">T4FHSA First Home Savings Account Statement</a> which will show the total of all:</p>
                       <ul><li>Qualifying withdrawals you made in the year in Box 20</li>
                       <li>Taxable withdrawals you made in the year in Box 22</li>
                       <li>Designated transfers you made in the year in Box 36</li>
                       <li>Designated withdrawals you made in the year in Box 38</li></ul>
                       <p>If you do <strong>not</strong> have an excess FHSA amount at the time of the transfer out of your FHSAs, you do <strong>not</strong> need to report the transfers out of your FHSAs into your RRSPs, RRIFs, or another one of your FHSAs on your income tax and benefit return.</p>
