She has been renting an apartment and has not occupied a property that she owned in the last six years.</p>
<p>On <span class="nowrap">November 5, 2028</span>, Donna Mae signed a written purchase agreement to buy a qualifying home. The purchase agreement stated that the closing date of the property will be <span class="nowrap">March 15, 2029</span>.

<p>On <span class="nowrap">January 11, 2029</span>, Donna Mae went to her financial institution to make a withdrawal from her FHSA. She filled out Form <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc725.html">RC725, Request to Make a Qualifying Withdrawal from your FHSA</a> and asked to withdraw the full amount of her FHSA, which was $33,000, for the purpose of buying a qualifying home.

        <h3 id="h-1-2">Making designated withdrawals or transfers from your FHSAs</h3>
<p>If you contribute or transfer to your FHSAs more than your FHSA participation room for the year, you will have an <a href="#excessfhsa" aria-controls="excessfhsa" class="wb-lbx" role="button">excess FHSA&nbsp;amount&nbsp;<span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a>. Generally, you have to pay a tax equal to 1% of the highest excess FHSA amount in the month until the excess FHSA amount is eliminated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have an excess FHSA amount, one of the ways that you can reduce or eliminate your excess FHSA amount is to make a designated withdrawal. The amount of the designated withdrawal is not required to be included as income on your income tax and benefit return in the year. For more information, go to&nbsp;<a href="toomuch.html">What happens if you contribute or transfer too much to your FHSAs</a>.</p>

     <h3 id="h-1-3">Transfers from your FHSAs to your RRSPs or RRIFs</h3>
	<p>You will be allowed to transfer property from your FHSAs to your RRSPs or RRIFs without any immediate tax consequences, as long as it is a <strong>direct transfer</strong> and you do not have an excess FHSA amount.</p>
<p>Generally, an amount that is transferred directly from your FHSAs to your RRSPs or RRIFs will not impact your unused RRSP deduction room or your unused FHSA participation room.</p>
<p>If you do not do a direct transfer, the amount you withdraw from your FHSA would be a taxable withdrawal and would be treated as a new RRSP contribution. That new contribution would reduce your unused RRSP deduction room and could result in RRSP excess contributions in certain cases.</p>
		 <p>To complete a direct transfer from your FHSAs to your RRSPs or RRIFs, you must fill out a transfer form and give it to your financial institution.&nbsp;<span class="label label-info">This form will be available at a later date.</span></p>

        <p>Anthony opened his FHSA in 2023. Over the years, he contributed the maximum amount to his FHSA, reaching his lifetime FHSA limit of $40,000 in 2027. It is now 2038, and Anthony must close his account by <span class="nowrap">December 31, 2038</span>, since it will reach the <a href="#maxpart" aria-controls="maxpart" class="wb-lbx" role="button">maximum participation period&nbsp;<span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a> of fifteen years on that date.

<p>If your transfer includes the excess FHSA amount, you must include the excess FHSA amount as income on your income tax and benefit return for the year of the transfer.
