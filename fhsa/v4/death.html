</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
  

  
<p>No contributions or transfers can be made to a deceased holder’s FHSAs after their date of death.
Also, transfers cannot be made from the deceased holder’s FHSAs to another of the deceased holder's FHSAs, registered retirement savings plans (RRSP), or registered retirement income funds (RRIFs).</p>
	<p>Distributions from the deceased holder's FHSAs can only be made to (or on behalf of) designated beneficiaries. If no beneficiaries have been designated, the amounts from the FHSA will be paid to the estate of the deceased holder.</p>
<p>Generally, the deceased holder is not required to include any amounts in their income in respect of the fair market value (FMV) of all the property held in their FHSAs at the time of their death. Under certain circumstances, however, there may be an inclusion in the income of the deceased holder’s estate.</p>
<p>If the deceased holder had an excess FHSA amount at the time of their death, special rules may apply. <span class="label label-info">Information about these rules will be available at a later date.</span></p>
</details></div>
</div>

		 <h3>Excess FHSA amount at the time of death</h3>
		 <p>If, in the year of death, there was an excess FHSA amount in the deceased holder’s FHSA, a tax of 1 per cent per month applies to the deceased holder on the highest excess FHSA amount for each month in which the excess stays in the FHSA, up to and including the month of death. The legal representative must file a return to report the excess FHSA amount and pay the applicable taxes. For more information about the return and when it will have to be filed, go to <a href="payable">FHSA taxes payable, assessments, and reassessments</a></p>
		 <p>For more information about excess FHSA amounts, go to <a href="toomuch.html">What happens if you contribute or transfer too much to your FHSAs</a></p>
 <h3>Exempt period after a holder's death</h3> 
<p>The exempt period begins when the holder dies and ends on December 31 of the first calendar year that begins after the holder's death, or when the trust ceases to exist, if earlier. For example, if a holder dies on April 1, 2023, the exempt period could continue until December 31, 2024.</p>


<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
  

  
      <h2><a id="h-3"></a>Types of beneficiaries</h2>
<p>After the death of the holder, the possible tax consequences will vary depending on the type of beneficiary and whether there is an excess FHSA amount at the time of death.</p>
<p>The types of beneficiaries of an FHSA who can be designated in the FHSA contract or the deceased holder’s will are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#h_3_1-1">A survivor who has been designated as the successor holder and is a qualifying individual</a></li>
<li><a href="#h_3_1-2">A survivor who has been designated as the successor holder but is not a qualifying individual</a></li>
<li><a href="#h_3_1-3">A survivor who has been designated as a beneficiary but not as the successor holder</a></li>
<li><a href="#h_3_1-4">Beneficiaries other than survivors</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Determining the type of beneficiary is the first important step.</p>
<p>The type of beneficiary will depend on:</p>
<ul>
<li>designations made in the deceased holder’s FHSA contract</li>
<li>designations made in the deceased holder’s will, if there is one</li>
<li>provincial or territorial succession legislation</li>
</ul>
<div class="alert alert-info"><p>Only the holder of an FHSA can change a prior beneficiary designation for the FHSA. If the holder wants to change a prior beneficiary designation in their FHSA contract, they need to contact their FHSA issuer.</p>

<p>If you are considered to have opened a new FHSA in respect of this FHSA, you will be considered to have opened the FHSA on the date you became the successor holder.

<p>If you decide to not keep the FHSA and make a taxable withdrawal for the full balance of the FHSA by the end of the exempt period, the amount you withdraw must be included as income on your income tax and benefit return for the year of the withdrawal. These amounts will be subject to withholding tax which can be claimed on your income tax and benefit return as a credit towards any tax owing for the year received.</p>
	  <p>You will receive a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t4fhsa.html">T4FHSA First Home Savings Account Statement slip</a> from the FHSA issuer showing the taxable withdrawal received in Box 22 and the income tax withholding in Box 30.</p>

	  <h5>If the deceased holder had an excess FHSA amount</h5>
	  <p>If the deceased holder had an excess FHSA amount at the time of their death and you became the successor holder of the FHSA immediately after the death of the holder, you may be deemed to have made a contribution to the FHSA on the first day of the month following the individual’s death. The amount of the deemed contribution, if any, will be equal to the deceased holder’s excess FHSA amount at the time of the deceased holder’s death <strong>minus</strong> the FMV of all property of the deceased holder’s FHSAs at the time of their death, which you did not become the successor holder of.</p>

<p>The FHSA will lose its status as an FHSA at the end of the exempt period.

If you do not know what type of FHSA the deceased had, ask the financial institution managing the FHSA if it was a depositary, trusteed or insured FHSA.</p>
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
<dt>Depositary FHSA</dt> <dd><p>Any income earned in the deceased holder’s depositary account after the exempt period and paid to the designated beneficiaries should be reported in accordance with normal taxation rules.</p>
</dd> <dt>Trusteed FHSA</dt> <dd><p>Any income earned in the deceased holder’s trust after the exempt period and paid to the designated beneficiaries will be reported by the trust. Only the part of the income earned in this period that is not taxable to the trust is reported by the beneficiary.

<p>All of the property of Horace’s FHSA was distributed to his estate on August 5, 2023. Horace’s FHSA had an FMV of $8,000 immediately before the distribution occurred.</p>
<p>On September 3, 2023, Audrey and the legal representative of Horace’s estate determined that Audrey was entitled to $3,000 of the FHSA from the estate. They completed a prescribed form and jointly elected to have the $3,000 treated as a deemed transfer from Horace’s FHSA (not from the estate) to Audrey’s RRSP. The transfer was completed on September 7, 2023.</p>
<p>As a result of the joint designation, the $3,000 was treated as a tax-deferred transfer from Horace’s FHSA to Audrey’s RRSP. There were no immediate tax consequences for Audrey.</p>
<p>As a result of the joint designation, Horace’s estate was only required to report $5,000 ($8,000 <strong>minus</strong> $3,000) as its income from the FHSA for 2023.</p>
