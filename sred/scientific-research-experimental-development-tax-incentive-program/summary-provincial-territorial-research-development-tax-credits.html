<p>For Ontario and federal corporate income tax purposes, taxpayers typically have tax pools with respect to amounts that can be carried over to another tax year—for example the pool for unclaimed <abbr title="scientific research and experimental development">SR&amp;ED</abbr> expenditures. Currently, tax pool balances may be different for federal and Ontario purposes. However, upon harmonizing with the federal definition of taxable income, each Ontario tax pool balance will assume its federal value (the amount in the federal pool). In many cases, this will require upward and downward adjustment to the Ontario pools, which may result in future Ontario tax gains or losses for corporations. SR&amp;ED performers may elect to defer the effects of the transitional tax debit related to unclaimed SR&amp;ED expenditures.</p>

<p>The amount of the&nbsp;credit is equal to&nbsp;15% on eligible expenditures made after <span class="nowrap">April 11, 2017.</span> The rate was previously <span class="nowrap">20%.</span></p> 
<p>One half of the tax credit on eligible expenditures for in-house R&amp;D is refundable. Therefore, after <span class="nowrap">April 11, 2017,</span> <span class="nowrap">7.5%</span> is refundable, the rest is non-refundable.</p> 
<p>Except, the tax credit on eligible expenditures, where the R&amp;D is carried on in Manitoba under R&amp;D contract with a qualifying institute, is fully refundable.</p>

<ul> 
 <li>to follow the federal reduction in the prescribed proxy amount</li> 
 <li>not to follow the federal change to SR&amp;ED provisions disallowing capital expenditures</li> 
 <li>to follow the federal reduction to 80% of the claimable portion of contract payments with the exception of contract payments to eligible educational institutions in Manitoba which remain fully eligible</li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong>Eligible work and expenditures:</strong><br> Those that qualify for the federal SR&amp;ED investment tax credit.</p>

<p>The carry-forward period for the non-refundable tax credit was 10 years for tax years ended after 2003 and 7 years for tax years ended before 2004.</p> 
<p>Those carrybacks/carryforwards are applied against the Manitoba income taxes payable.</p> 
<p><strong>Assistance:</strong><br> Eligible expenditures are reduced by government and non-government assistance.<br> The Manitoba R&amp;D tax credit will reduce the federal pool of deductible SR&amp;ED expenditures and qualified SR&amp;ED expenditures.</p>

<p><strong>Ability to renounce:</strong><br> A corporation can renounce its entitlement to all or part of the Manitoba R&amp;D tax credit that is attributable to eligible expenditures incurred in a tax year up to one year after its filing due date for the tax year.
