<p>The Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI) is a process that involves the exchange of predefined taxpayer financial account information about non-residents and U.S. citizens to the jurisdiction of tax residence.  The goal is to ensure tax transparency between countries and to combat tax evasion.</p>
		<p>The Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI) is a process whereby  tax information on residents who have accounts abroad is systematically and  periodically transmitted to the jurisdiction of tax residence. Under these  exchanges, the CRA sends information to partner jurisdictions and simultaneously  receives information regarding Canadian residents who hold financial accounts  offshore or abroad. The goal is to ensure tax transparency between countries  and to combat tax evasion.</p><p>
 While AEOI can cover various categories of information the focus of this webpage will be on the automatic exchange of <strong>financial account information</strong>. </p><p>
  Canada participates in two automatic exchanges of financial account information:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) </li>
  <li>Common Reporting Standard (CRS)</li>
</ul>
<p>Under these exchange, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) sends financial account information about non-residents to partner jurisdictions and receives information about Canadian residents who hold financial accounts in other jurisdictions.</p>>
<p>Both FATCA and CRS require financial institutions to identify customers who directly or indirectly  hold financial accounts in jurisdictions where they are not residents. Financial institutions must ask customers to disclose their tax status and submit documents to support it.</p>
<h2>What  is the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)</h2>
<p>The U.S. government enacted the  Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) in March 2010. FATCA is a law that requires non-U.S. financial institutions to report the financial account information of specified U.S. persons to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  These persons can include U.S. citizens or residents. </p>
<p>
Canada signed an intergovernmental agreement (IGA) in 2014 that governs the automatic exchange of financial account information with the United States. The IGA was implemented under Part XVIII, Enhanced International Information Reporting, of the Income Tax Act. Part XVIII details the requirements for Canadian financial institutions to report to the CRA any accounts held or controlled by specified U.S. persons. The CRA then exchanges this information with the IRS.</p>
<p>Under these exchanges, the CRA simultaneously receives similar information from the IRS about Canadian residents who hold financial accounts in the United States.

<h2>What is the  Common Reporting Standard (CRS)</h2>
 <p>The Common Reporting Standard (CRS) is an international standard for  reporting, collecting, and exchanging financial account information.  The  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) developed the CRS to combat cross-border tax evasion.. The CRS requires financial institutions to report to the tax administration of their jurisdiction any accounts held or controlled by non-residents. The administration then exchanges the information with the jurisdiction where the account holder is a  tax resident.</p>
<p>The CRS was implemented in Canada on December 15, 2016, under Part XIX of the Income Tax Act and became effective on July 1, 2017. It requires Canadian financial institutions to report financial account information to the CRA.  The CRA then  exchanges this information with partner jurisdictions under the provisions and safeguards of the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters or a related bilateral tax treaty. So far, more than 100 jurisdictions have signed on to the CRS.
