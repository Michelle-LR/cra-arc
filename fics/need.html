<h1 property="name" id="wb-cont" class="gc-thickline">What is needed from account holders</h1>
<p>In order for the CRA to exchange financial account information with other jurisdictions, you may be asked by your financial institution to <strong>certify or clarify your tax residence</strong>, and to provide identifying information such as a Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) that is relevant to your jurisdiction of residence.  Account holders who fail to comply with such a request may have their financial account information reported to the CRA.
</p>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol class="lst-stps">
<li><h3>Know the types of account holders</h3>
<p>There are 2 types of account holders:</p>
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
<dt>Individual account  holders</dt>
<dd>Any individual who holds an account with a Canadian financial institution</dd>
<dt>Entity account  holders</dt>
<dd>Any corporation, trust, partnership, and other organizations (hereafter referred to as entities) that hold  an account with Canadian financial institutions</dd>
</dl>
<li><h3>Self-certify</h3>
<p>A self-certification is a declaration by the account holder that gives their identification details, tax residency, and any other information that may reasonably be required by financial institutions to fulfil its due diligence and reporting obligations.</p>
<p>A self-certification can be obtained verbally or electronically. It can be provided as a stand-alone document, or it can be part of a more comprehensive document used by a financial institution in connection with the account opening.  As long as the document allows the account holder to positively acknowledge by signature or other means that the self-certification is valid, the document can be considered a self-certification. 
</p>

		<summary>Self-certification of  individual account  holders</summary>
		<p>Financial institutions have to know the tax status of the account holders and others they deal with.</p>
<p>If you are a new client at a financial institution, your financial  institution will ask you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To certify your tax residency and whether you are a non-resident of Canada or a U.S. citizen when you open your account</li>
  <li>To provide documents to support any representation you make</li>
</ul>
<p>Your financial institution will confirm the reasonableness of this self-certification based on the information it gets.</p>
<p>If your situation later changes in a way that suggests you may be a non-resident of Canada or a U.S. citizen (for example, you change your address to an address outside Canada), your financial institution must verify your residence status. This may include following up with you.</p>
<p>The CRA has developed forms that financial institutions can use to collect the information they need to determine the tax residency of an account holder and of any controlling persons.  However, financial institutions are free to collect the information in other ways, as long as they meet their reporting obligations.
</p>
		<h4>Determining residence status for Canadian tax purposes</h4>
<p>Under Canada's tax system, income tax obligations are based on your tax residence status. You need to know your tax residence status before you can determine your tax responsibilities. Residents of Canada are taxable in Canada on their worldwide income whereas non-residents are taxable in Canada only on their income from Canadian sources. </p>
<p>Financial institutions have to know the tax residence of their account holders to ensure proper withholding and reporting. Therefore, financial institutions may ask you to certify or clarify your residence status for Canadian tax purposes.  Tax residence is determined on a case by case basis. It is based on your situation and all the relevant facts. The relevant facts in determining your tax residence include:
 </p>
<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span> Residential       ties you have in Canada and abroad</li>
  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span> The purpose       and permanence of your stay in Canada and abroad</li>
</ul>
<p>Residential ties include social and  economic ties, such as a home, personal belongings, and family. </p>
<p> If you are an individual who normally  lives in Canada, files an income tax and benefit return as a resident of  Canada, and pays tax on worldwide income each year to Canada, you can inform  your financial institution that you are a resident of Canada for tax purposes.  However, even if you are a resident of Canada for tax purposes, if you are a  U.S. citizen, you may have to inform your financial institution that you are also a  U.S. citizen. </p>
<p> If you have no significant residential  ties with Canada and you have lived outside Canada during the year, you may be  considered a non-resident of Canada. </p>
<p> If you need help in determining your tax  residence status, refer to: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/international-non-residents/information-been-moved/determining-your-residency-status.html">Determining  your residency status</a></p>

<h4>Account holders with multiple residency</h4>
<p>If you are an individual who is a resident of Canada as well as another jurisdiction that Canada has a tax treaty with, the tie-breaker rules may help you to determine your jurisdiction of residence. You can find the tiebreaker rules under the residence article of the relevant tax treaty.
</p>
<p>For example, you may be a resident of Canada for tax purposes but you may also hold a green card (that is, a permanent resident card for the U.S.), in which case the U.S. considers you to be a U.S. resident. If you are a U.S. citizen, you may have to inform your financial institution that you are a U.S. citizen. However, if you are not a U.S. citizen and are considered a resident of Canada according to the tie-breaker rules under the Canada–U.S. tax treaty,  you can tell your financial institution you are a resident of Canada and not a resident of the U.S. If you have relinquished your U.S. citizenship, your financial institution may ask individuals you for supporting documents.</p>

<p>If you are an individual who is   a resident of Canada and of another jurisdiction that Canada  does not have a tax treaty with, you must inform your financial institution that you  are a resident of both jurisdictions for tax purposes. Refer to: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/programs/tax-policy/tax-treaties.html">Canada's tax  treaties</a></p>

<li><h3>Be aware of information sharing practices</h3>
<p>Designed to improve tax compliance, the two AEOI regimes  Part XVIII (FATCA) and Part XIX (CRS) require Canadian financial institutions to collect certain information from their account holders.</p>
<div class="wb-tabs">
	<div class="tabpanels">
		<details id="details-panel1">
			<summary>How financial institutions report on individual account  holders</summary>
			
			<p>Financial institutions have to report financial information with respect to most bank accounts, mutual funds, brokerage accounts, custodial accounts, annuity contracts (including segregated fund contracts), and some life insurance policies with a cash value that are held by non-residents of Canada or U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>They do not have to report financial information with respect to certain accounts, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Registered retirement savings plans (RRSP)</li>
  <li>Registered retirement income funds (RRIF)</li>
  <li>Pooled registered pension plans (PRPP)</li>
  <li>Registered pension plans (RPP)</li>
  <li>Tax-free savings accounts (TFSA)</li>
  <li>Registered disability savings plans (RDSP)</li>
  <li>Registered education savings plans (RESP)</li>
  <li>Deferred profit-sharing plans (DPSP)</li>
</ul>



<p>Due diligence procedures require Canadian financial institutions to identify account holders who are non-residents of Canada, or are U.S. citizens. As an individual account holder, you may be asked to certify or clarify your tax residence to your financial institution.  This is done by asking accounts holders:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To declare their tax residence and whether they are non-residents of Canada or U.S. citizens</li>
  <li>To produce documents such as a driver's licence for any  representation they make</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are a U.S. resident or a U.S. citizen, the financial institution must give your financial account information to the CRA. The CRA then gives that information to the IRS. If you are a resident of a jurisdiction other than the U.S., the financial institution  must also give your financial account information to the CRA.  The CRA then gives the relevant financial information to CRS partner jurisdictions. In return, the IRS and CRS partner jurisdictions give the CRA similar information on Canadian residents who have financial accounts with financial institutions  in their jurisdictions. The agreements are strictly information-sharing and do not involve any new or higher taxes. The sharing of information has no effect on foreign filing or reporting requirements.

</ul>
<p>Account holders who fail to provide a self-certification or other information upon requests from their financial institution may have their financial account reported to the CRA.   Safeguards are in place to ensure that the U.S. and our CRS partners treat the taxpayer information they receive as confidential and use it solely to administer tax laws. </p>


<h3>Information reported to the CRA and shared with the U.S. or CRS partner</h3>
<p>The account information the CRA collects and shares with the U.S. or the CRS partner includes the account holder's:</p>
<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>Name </li>
  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>Address</li>

  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN)</li>
  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>Date of birth (in some circumstances)</li>
  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>Account number, account balance or value, and amounts paid or  credited to the account</li>
</ul>
<p>If a financial institution identifies a joint account as a reportable account, it will report the full value of the account to the CRA. Only information relating to non-residents joint account holders will be exchanged.  Information relating to joint account holders who are residents of Canada and are not U.S. citizens will not be exchanged. </p>
<p>Although a financial institution does not have to notify their account holders that it has reported their financial account information to the CRA, it must be open about their policies and procedures on reporting obligations. The Canadian financial institutions must be prepared to make this information available by allowing account holders to have access to the personal information that has been reported.</p>
<p>As an account holder, you can also contact the CRA to find out if we have received your information or shared it with the U.S. or your jurisdiction of tax residence.
</p>

			<summary>How financial institutions report on entity account  holders</summary>
			
		

		 

<p>Due diligence procedures require financial institutions to identify entity account holders that are specified U.S. persons or reportable persons, controlled by U.S. residents or U.S. citizens or non-residents. This is done by asking for and reviewing information from:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Account holders </li>
  <li>Account records</li>
  <li>Publicly available sources </li>
</ul>
<p>To meet their tax reporting obligations with the CRA, Canadian financial institutions require certain information about entity account holders. Financial institutions have to determine: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Where       an entity is <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/international-non-residents/enhanced-financial-account-information-reporting/information-entities-holding-accounts-canadian-financial-institutions.html#Residence_status">resident</a> for       tax purposes</li>

</ul>
<p>Once the CRA receives this information it is shared with the IRS and partner jurisdictions.
 </p>
<p> All of Canada's bilateral tax treaties contain strong safeguards to ensure that the IRS and CRS partner jurisdictions treat the taxpayer information they receive as confidential and use it only to administer tax laws. As well, both the IRS and CRS partner jurisdictions reciprocate by sending the CRA similar information on Canadian entities and entities controlled by Canadian residents holding accounts with financial institutions located in their jurisdictions.</p>
<p> Account information that is shared  includes the entity's: </p>
<ul class="fa-ul mrgn-bttm-md">

<p>If a non-financial entity or a non-financial foreign entity is identified as having a controlling person that is a non-resident or a specified U.S. person, the information that is shared includes the controlling person's: </p>

<h4>Entities that are reportable</h4>
	<dl class="dl-horizontal">
<dt>Residence status</dt><dd>
<p>Generally, an entity will be a tax resident of a jurisdiction if, , it pays or should be paying tax under the laws of that jurisdiction  because of its domicile, residence, place of management or incorporation, or any other similar criterion. An entity will generally be considered resident if it is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A corporation, in the jurisdiction where it is  incorporated</li>
  <li>A trust, in the jurisdiction where its place of  management and control is located</li>
  <li>A partnership, a limited partnership, or a similar legal  arrangement, in the jurisdiction where its place of management is located</li>
</ul>
<p>For  more information refer to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Residency of a corporation </li>
  <li>Residency of a trust or estate </li>
</ul>
	</dd>
<dt>U.S.  person</dt><dd>
<p> Generally  speaking, an entity is a U.S. person if it is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a corporation or partnership organized in the United States</li>
  <li>a trust subject to U.S. law that is controlled by one or more U.S.  citizens or U.S. residents, for tax purposes</li>
  <li>a testamentary trust of a deceased person who was a U.S. citizen  or a U.S. resident, for tax purposes when they died</li>
</ul>
<p>A corporation  that was incorporated in Canada, or organized in any other jurisdiction outside  of the United States, is not generally a U.S. person.</p>
<p> For  more information refer to:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/classification-of-taxpayers-for-us-tax-purposes">Classification  of Taxpayers for U.S. Tax Purposes </a></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Specified U.S. person</dt><dd>
<p> An entity that is a U.S. person is not a specified U.S. person if it is a corporation whose stock is regularly traded on an established securities market, or if it is a U.S. agency or government. Also, a specified U.S. person does not include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A trust or an organization exempt from tax</li>
  <li>A bank, a real estate investment trust, a regulated investment company, a common trust fund, or a securities or commodities dealer</li>
  <li>A corporation that is related to a corporation whose stock is publicly traded</li>
</ul>
<p>If an entity falls into one of the categories in that list, it should consult the definition of specified U.S. person in subparagraph 1(ff) of Article 1 of the  <a href="http://www.fin.gc.ca/treaties-conventions/pdf/FATCA-eng.pdf">Intergovernmental Agreement for the  Enhanced Exchange of Financial Account Information under the Canada-U.S. Tax  Convention</a>  to determine if it can certify that it is not a specified U.S. person.</p>
		</dd>
<dt>Financial  institution</dt><dd>
<p> An entity  that holds an account at a financial institution in Canada may be asked to  declare whether it is a financial institution. Accounts held by an entity that  is a financial institution are generally not reportable.</p>
<p> To be a  financial institution, an entity must be a custodial institution, a depository  institution, an investment entity, or a specified insurance company that offers  insurance contracts with an investment component or annuity contracts. </p>
<p> An entity resident in Canada that is a financial institution must determine whether it is a Canadian financial institution when completing a self-certification form. An entity resident in Canada that is not a Canadian financial institution is a non-financial entity (NFE) or a non-financial foreign entity (NFFE) unless it is prescribed as a non-reporting financial institution. This entity has to identify itself as an active or passive NFE/NFFE. An entity that is prescribed as a non-reporting financial institution can identify itself as a financial institution, even if it is not a Canadian financial institution.</p>

<p> An entity  that holds an account at a financial institution in Canada may be asked whether  it is an investment entity in a non-participating jurisdiction, if it is  managed by another financial institution. If that is the case, and at least 50%  of its gross income is from investing or trading in financial assets, it will  be considered a passive non-financial entity.</p>

<dt>Non-financial entity</dt><dd>
<p>Under Part XIX, all entities resident in Canada are non-financial entities (NFEs) if they are not Canadian financial institutions while all entities that are not resident in Canada are NFEs if they are not financial institutions.</p>
<p> Example:</p>
<p> Bill is a  carpenter whose business (entity) is incorporated in Canada. Since Bill's  entity is not a financial institution, it is an NFE. </p>
		</dd>
<dt>Non-financial  foreign entity</dt><dd>


<p>The agreement with the U.S. uses the term non-financial foreign entity (NFFE), whereas the CRS uses the term non-financial entity (NFE). For the purposes of the CRS, a U.S. entity that is not a financial institution is an NFE, and unless specifically stated, the term NFE has the same meaning throughout this document.
</p>
<p>Under Part XVIII, all entities resident in Canada are non-financial foreign entities (NFFEs) if they are not Canadian financial institutions while all non-U.S. entities other than entities resident in Canada are NFFEs if they are not financial institutions.</p>
		</dd>
<dt>Active  non-financial entity</dt><dd>
<p> An entity  that carries on an active trade or business is generally an active  non-financial entity (active NFE). An active NFE also includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a public       corporation with shares that regularly trade on an established securities       exchange (for example, the Toronto Stock Exchange or the New York Stock       Exchange)</li>
  <li>an       entity related to a public corporation (as described in the first bullet point)</li>
  <li>a government (or an agency or its instrumentality thereof) that performs governmental functions</li>
  <li>a       non-profit organization that is exempt from tax</li>
</ul>
<p>A Canadian corporation that is dedicated only to running a restaurant, a hair salon, a car dealership, or a factory is engaged in an active pursuit and is an active NFE. On the other hand, a personal investment corporation or a trust that holds investments to produce passive income is not an active NFE.</p>
<p> A business corporation or other entity can be involved in multiple activities or hold a combination of assets. This makes it more difficult to know whether it should be categorized as an active NFE. For example, a corporation may be carrying on an active business but also earning significant income from portfolio holdings. It is an active NFE as long as the entity earned less than 50% of its gross income in its last fiscal year from passive income; and held less than 50% of its assets that year to generate passive income (the passive income/asset test).
</p>
<p> Passive income generally includes income from holding investment property, such as interest, dividends, and rent.</p>
<p> Example:</p>
<p> Michele is a professional photographer and her business is incorporated as ABC Photo in Alberta. She is the only shareholder of the corporation. In ABC Photo’s  last fiscal year, 70% of its income was from fees and commissions, and 30% was from passive income in the form of interest and dividends from assets ABC Photo owned. Those assets, represent 25% of ABC Photo’s total assets.
</p>
<p> ABC Photo is an active NFE.</p>
		</dd>
<dt>Passive  non-financial entity</dt><dd>
<p>Most entities that do not engage in substantive business activities to produce a good or a service and that are not active NFEs are passive NFEs.</p>
<p> Under the CRS, an entity is considered a passive NFE if it is an investment entity in a non-participating jurisdiction, it is managed by another financial institution and at least 50% of its gross income is from investing or trading in financial assets.</p>
<p> Example:</p>
<p> Joe is an  optometrist whose practice is incorporated in Quebec. He is the sole shareholder  of the corporation. He is preparing to retire and has reduced the number of  hours he works. So the portfolio owned by the corporation now earns more income  from investment assets than from fees for service. As reported for the last  fiscal year, 40% of the corporation's income was from fees and 60% was passive  income from investment assets.</p>
<p> Joe's  corporation is a passive NFE.</p>
		</dd>
<dt>Active  or passive NFE, or an NFFE</dt><dd>
<p> An entity may need more information to determine whether it is an active or a passive NFE, or an NFFE. Before certifying its status, an entity should check the definitions of passive and active NFE in subsection 270(1) of the Income Tax Act and of active and passive NFFE in Annex I of Section VI of the <a href="http://www.fin.gc.ca/treaties-conventions/pdf/FATCA-eng.pdf"> Intergovernmental Agreement for  the Enhanced Exchange of Financial Account Information under the Canada-U.S.  Tax Convention</a>. </p>
<p>The distinction between active and passive NFE or NFFE is important. If an account holder is a passive NFE, the financial institution must identify all of the holder's controlling persons who are non-residents of Canada. If the account holder is a passive NFFE, you must identify all of the holder's controlling persons who are U.S. residents or U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>To report a financial account of a passive NFE or NFFE, the financial institution has   to collect information about the entity's controlling persons. Therefore,  the financial institution that maintains the account of an entity controlled by a non-resident of Canada or a U.S. citizen may have to report that controlling person's date of birth and taxpayer identification number (TIN) associated with such jurisdiction of tax residence when reporting information to the CRA. If the controlling person is a non-resident of Canada or a U.S. citizen, they must give  their date of birth and TIN to the financial institution when asked for it. For U.S. residents and U.S. citizens, the TIN is generally the U.S. social security number. If the controlling person has a Canadian social insurance number (SIN),they must also give that number.</p>

<dt>Controlling  persons</dt><dd>
<p>The term <strong>controlling persons</strong> of an entity means the individuals who directly or indirectly controls  the entity. Generally, whether an individual has control over an entity is determined by how beneficial owners are identified in the Proceeds of Crime Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Act, and by the ownership thresholds set by Canadian financial regulatory authorities.
.</p>
<p><strong>For a corporation</strong>, an individual is considered to be a controlling person if they directly or indirectly own or control 25% or more of the corporation. If no individual controls the corporation through ownership interests or voting rights, the controlling persons are  the individuals who exercise control of the corporation through other means, such as the directors. If no individual exercises control of the corporation through other means, the controlling persons are the senior managing officials, for example, a CEO of the corporation.</p>
<p><strong> For a trust</strong>, the controlling persons include its settlors, trustees, protectors (if any), beneficiaries or class of beneficiaries, and any other individuals having ultimate effective control over the trust. A person is a beneficiary if they have the right to receive, directly or indirectly, a mandatory distribution or if they receive, directly or indirectly, a discretionary distribution from the trust. For discretionary distributions, the beneficiary is a beneficiary only for the calendar year they receive a distribution.
</p>
<p><strong>For a legal arrangement other than a trust</strong>, depending on the control structure of the arrangement, where the control is exercised through ownership, the controlling persons are individuals in equivalent or similar position as in a trust who directly or indirectly own or control 25% or more of the legal arrangement and where the control is exercised through other means than ownership, the controlling persons are t individuals in equivalent or similar positions as in a trust.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Controlling persons of a passive NFE</dt><dd>
<p>When the controlling person of a passive NFE is an entity, you have to look through the entity’s chain of control or ownership to identify the individuals  who are the controlling persons.</p>
<p>In the case of a passive NFE that is a corporation, where the control or ownership of the passive NFE is with a trust, i.e., and the trust directly or indirectly owns or controls 25% or more of the passive NFE, the financial institution must obtain information on all natural persons who are controlling persons of the trust.In the case of a passive NFE that is a corporation, where the control or ownership of the passive NFE is with another corporation that directly or indirectly owns or controls 25% or more of the passive NFE, the financial institution must obtain information on all natural persons who directly or indirectly own or control 25% or more of the corporation.

</ul>
		</dd>
<dt>Types  of controlling persons</dt><dd>
<p>As the financial institution, you can ask an individual to describe the type of controlling person. You have to identify if the individual is controlling the entity through ownership interests, voting rights or other means. If you cannot identify the  individual who is controlling the entity the entity account holder must disclose the senior managing official as the controlling person. For a trust, you have to identify who the controlling person is: the settlor, the trustee, the protector, or a beneficiary. For other legal arrangements, you have to identify the controlling person as: the equivalent of a settlor, a trustee, a protector, or a beneficiary of that legal arrangement.</p>
