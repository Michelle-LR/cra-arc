<h1 property="name" id="wb-cont" class="gc-thickline">What is needed from account holders</h1>
<p>In order for the CRA to exchange financial account information with other jurisdictions, you may be asked by your <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/international-non-residents/enhanced-financial-account-information-reporting/information-entities-holding-accounts-canadian-financial-institutions.html#Financial_institution">financial institution</a> to <strong>certify or clarify your tax residence</strong>, and to provide identifying information such as a Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) that is relevant to your jurisdiction of residence.  Account holders who fail to comply with such a request may have their financial account information reported to the CRA.
</p>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol class="lst-stps">
<li><h3>Know the types of account holders</h3>
<p>There are 2 types of account holders:</p>
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
<dt>Individual account  holders</dt>
<dd>Any individual who holds an account with a Canadian financial institution</dd>
<dt>Entity account  holders</dt>
<dd>Any corporation, trust, partnership, and other organizations (hereafter referred to as entities) that hold  an account with Canadian financial institutions</dd>
</dl>
<li><h3>Self-certify</h3>
<p>A self-certification is a declaration by the account holder that gives their identification details, tax residency, and any other information that may reasonably be required by financial institutions to fulfil its due diligence and reporting obligations.</p>
<p>A self-certification can be obtained verbally or electronically. It can be provided as a stand-alone document, or it can be part of a more comprehensive document used by a financial institution in connection with the account opening.  As long as the document allows the account holder to positively acknowledge by signature or other means that the self-certification is valid, the document can be considered a self-certification. 
</p>

		<summary>Self-certification of  individual account  holders</summary>
		<p>Financial institutions have to know the tax status of the account holders and others they deal with.</p>
<p>If you are a new client at a financial institution, your financial  institution will ask you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To certify your tax residency and whether you are a non-resident of Canada or a U.S. citizen when you open your account</li>
  <li>To provide documents to support any representation you make</li>
</ul>
<p>Your financial institution will confirm the reasonableness of this self-certification based on the information it gets.</p>
<p>If your situation later changes in a way that suggests you may be a non-resident of Canada or a U.S. citizen (for example, you change your address to an address outside Canada), your financial institution must verify your <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/international-non-residents/enhanced-financial-account-information-reporting/information-entities-holding-accounts-canadian-financial-institutions.html#Residence_status">residence status</a>. This may include following up with you.</p>
<p>The CRA has developed forms that financial institutions can use to collect the information they need to determine the tax residency of an account holder and of any controlling persons.  However, financial institutions are free to collect the information in other ways, as long as they meet their reporting obligations.
</p>
		<h4>Determining residence status for Canadian tax purposes</h4>
<p>Under Canada's tax system, income tax obligations are based on your tax residence status. You need to know your tax residence status before you can determine your tax responsibilities. Residents of Canada are taxable in Canada on their worldwide income whereas non-residents are taxable in Canada only on their income from Canadian sources. </p>
<p>Financial institutions have to know the tax residence of their account holders to ensure proper withholding and reporting. Therefore, financial institutions may ask you to certify or clarify your residence status for Canadian tax purposes.  Tax residence is determined on a case by case basis. It is based on your situation and all the relevant facts. The relevant facts in determining your tax residence include:
 </p>
<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span> Residential       ties you have in Canada and abroad</li>
  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span> The purpose       and permanence of your stay in Canada and abroad</li>
</ul>
<p>Residential ties include social and  economic ties, such as a home, personal belongings, and family. </p>
<p> If you are an individual who normally  lives in Canada, files an income tax and benefit return as a resident of  Canada, and pays tax on worldwide income each year to Canada, you can inform  your financial institution that you are a resident of Canada for tax purposes.  However, even if you are a resident of Canada for tax purposes, if you are a  U.S. citizen, you may have to inform your financial institution that you are also a  U.S. citizen. </p>
<p> If you have no significant residential  ties with Canada and you have lived outside Canada during the year, you may be  considered a non-resident of Canada. </p>
<p> If you need help in determining your tax  residence status, refer to: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/international-non-residents/information-been-moved/determining-your-residency-status.html">Determining  your residency status</a></p>

<h4>Account holders with multiple residency</h4>
<p>If you are an individual who is a resident of Canada as well as another jurisdiction that Canada has a tax treaty with, the tie-breaker rules may help you to determine your jurisdiction of residence. You can find the tiebreaker rules under the residence article of the relevant tax treaty.
</p>
<p>For example, you may be a resident of Canada for tax purposes but you may also hold a green card (that is, a permanent resident card for the U.S.), in which case the U.S. considers you to be a U.S. resident. If you are a U.S. citizen, you may have to inform your financial institution that you are a U.S. citizen. However, if you are not a U.S. citizen and are considered a resident of Canada according to the tie-breaker rules under the Canada–U.S. tax treaty,  you can tell your financial institution you are a resident of Canada and not a resident of the U.S. If you have relinquished your U.S. citizenship, your financial institution may ask individuals you for supporting documents.</p>

<p>If you are an individual who is   a resident of Canada and of another jurisdiction that Canada  does not have a tax treaty with, you must inform your financial institution that you  are a resident of both jurisdictions for tax purposes. Refer to: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/programs/tax-policy/tax-treaties.html">Canada's tax  treaties</a></p>

<li><h3>Be aware of information sharing practices</h3>
<p>Designed to improve tax compliance, the two AEOI regimes  Part XVIII (FATCA) and Part XIX (CRS) require Canadian financial institutions to collect certain information from their account holders.</p>
<div class="wb-tabs">
	<div class="tabpanels">
		<details id="details-panel1">
			<summary>How financial institutions report on individual account  holders</summary>
			
			<p>Financial institutions have to report financial information with respect to most bank accounts, mutual funds, brokerage accounts, custodial accounts, annuity contracts (including segregated fund contracts), and some life insurance policies with a cash value that are held by non-residents of Canada or U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>They do not have to report financial information with respect to certain accounts, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Registered retirement savings plans (RRSP)</li>
  <li>Registered retirement income funds (RRIF)</li>
  <li>Pooled registered pension plans (PRPP)</li>
  <li>Registered pension plans (RPP)</li>
  <li>Tax-free savings accounts (TFSA)</li>
  <li>Registered disability savings plans (RDSP)</li>
  <li>Registered education savings plans (RESP)</li>
  <li>Deferred profit-sharing plans (DPSP)</li>
</ul>



<p>Due diligence procedures require Canadian financial institutions to identify account holders who are non-residents of Canada, or are U.S. citizens. As an individual account holder, you may be asked to certify or clarify your tax residence to your financial institution.  This is done by asking accounts holders:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To declare their tax residence and whether they are non-residents of Canada or U.S. citizens</li>
  <li>To produce documents such as a driver's licence for any  representation they make</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are a U.S. resident or a U.S. citizen, the financial institution must give your financial account information to the CRA. The CRA then gives that information to the IRS. If you are a resident of a jurisdiction other than the U.S., the financial institution  must also give your financial account information to the CRA.  The CRA then gives the relevant financial information to CRS partner jurisdictions. In return, the IRS and CRS partner jurisdictions give the CRA similar information on Canadian residents who have financial accounts with financial institutions  in their jurisdictions. The agreements are strictly information-sharing and do not involve any new or higher taxes. The sharing of information has no effect on foreign filing or reporting requirements.

</ul>
<p>Account holders who fail to provide a self-certification or other information upon requests from their financial institution may have their financial account reported to the CRA.   Safeguards are in place to ensure that the U.S. and our CRS partners treat the taxpayer information they receive as confidential and use it solely to administer tax laws. </p>


<h3>Information reported to the CRA and shared with the U.S. or CRS partner</h3>
<p>The account information the CRA collects and shares with the U.S. or the CRS partner includes the account holder's:</p>
<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>Name </li>
  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>Address</li>
  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>Jurisdiction of residence </li>
  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN)</li>
  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>Date of birth (in some circumstances)</li>
  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>Account number, account balance or value, and amounts paid or  credited to the account</li>
</ul>
<p>If a financial institution identifies a joint account as a reportable account, it will report the full value of the account to the CRA. Only information relating to non-residents joint account holders will be exchanged.  Information relating to joint account holders who are residents of Canada and are not U.S. citizens will not be exchanged. </p>
<p>Although a financial institution does not have to notify their account holders that it has reported their financial account information to the CRA, it must be open about their policies and procedures on reporting obligations. The Canadian financial institutions must be prepared to make this information available by allowing account holders to have access to the personal information that has been reported.</p>
<p>As an account holder, you can also contact the CRA to find out if we have received your information or shared it with the U.S. or your jurisdiction of tax residence.
</p>


		</details>
		<details id="details-panel2">
			<summary>How financial institutions report on entity account  holders</summary>
			
		

		 

<p>Due diligence procedures require financial institutions to identify entity account holders that are specified U.S. persons or reportable persons, controlled by U.S. residents or U.S. citizens or non-residents. This is done by asking for and reviewing information from:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Account holders </li>
  <li>Account records</li>
  <li>Publicly available sources </li>
</ul>
<p>To meet their tax reporting obligations with the CRA, Canadian financial institutions require certain information about entity account holders. Financial institutions have to determine: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Where       an entity is <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/international-non-residents/enhanced-financial-account-information-reporting/information-entities-holding-accounts-canadian-financial-institutions.html#Residence_status">resident</a> for       tax purposes</li>
  <li>Whether       the entity is a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/international-non-residents/enhanced-financial-account-information-reporting/information-entities-holding-accounts-canadian-financial-institutions.html#US_Person">U.S. person</a> and,       if so, whether it is a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/international-non-residents/enhanced-financial-account-information-reporting/information-entities-holding-accounts-canadian-financial-institutions.html#Soecified_US_Person">specified U.S. person</a></li>
  <li>Whether       the entity is a non-resident person and, if so, whether it is a reportable       person</li>
  <li>Whether       the entity is a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/international-non-residents/enhanced-financial-account-information-reporting/information-entities-holding-accounts-canadian-financial-institutions.html#Financial_institution">financial institution</a> and, if so, what type</li>
  <li>Whether       the entity is a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/international-non-residents/enhanced-financial-account-information-reporting/information-entities-holding-accounts-canadian-financial-institutions.html#Non_financial_entity">non-financial entity</a> (or       a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/international-non-residents/enhanced-financial-account-information-reporting/information-entities-holding-accounts-canadian-financial-institutions.html#nffe">non-financial foreign entity</a>) and, if so, whether it is a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/international-non-residents/enhanced-financial-account-information-reporting/information-entities-holding-accounts-canadian-financial-institutions.html#Passive_NFE">passive non-financial entity</a> controlled by non-residents or       a passive non-financial foreign entity controlled by U.S. residents or       U.S. citizens</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the CRA receives this information it is shared with the IRS and partner jurisdictions.
 </p>
<p> All of Canada's bilateral tax treaties contain strong safeguards to ensure that the IRS and CRS partner jurisdictions treat the taxpayer information they receive as confidential and use it only to administer tax laws. As well, both the IRS and CRS partner jurisdictions reciprocate by sending the CRA similar information on Canadian entities and entities controlled by Canadian residents holding accounts with financial institutions located in their jurisdictions.</p>
<p> Account information that is shared  includes the entity's: </p>
<ul class="fa-ul mrgn-bttm-md">
  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>Name </li>
  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>Address </li>
  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>Jurisdiction of residence </li>
  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>Taxpayer Identification  Number (TIN) </li>
  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>Account number, account balance or value, and amounts paid or  credited to the account</li>
</ul>
<p>If a non-financial entity or a non-financial foreign entity is identified as having a controlling person that is a non-resident or a specified U.S. person, the information that is shared includes the controlling person's: </p>
<ul class="fa-ul mrgn-bttm-md">
  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span> Name </li>
  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>Address </li>
  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>Date of Birth (in certain  cases) </li>
  <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>Jurisdiction of residence </li>
