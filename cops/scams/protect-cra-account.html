<h2 id="h1">Monitor your accounts regularly</h2>
	<p>It’s important to monitor your CRA accounts for any suspicious activity. Suspicious activity includes: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Regularly monitor your CRA accounts (My Account, My Business Account, or Represent a Client) for any signs of unusual behavior</li> 
<li>Keep an eye out for unexpected changes to your address, direct deposit details, or benefit applications</li>
<li>Be vigilant for changes to your information that you did not make or ask for, such as, banking details, mailing address, representatives, or benefit applications</li>
<li>Ensure that the CRA has your correct email address to receive early warning notifications about significant changes to your account</li>
<!--<li><strong>Check your online CRA accounts regularly for any suspicious activity.</strong> This includes unsolicited changes to your address and direct deposit information, or benefit applications made on your behalf.</li>
	<li>Suspicious activity includes changes to your information that you did not make or ask for, such as banking, mailing address, representatives or benefit applications.</li>
<li><strong>Make sure we have your correct email address at all times.</strong> <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-individuals/online-mail-helping-you-organize-your-canada-revenue-agency-mail.html">Email notifications</a> from the CRA let you know when important changes are made on your account. These notifications can act as an early warning for potential fraudulent activity.</li>-->
</ul> 

<h2 id="h2">How to protect your CRA accounts</h2>
	<p>Protect your CRA account from incidents.</p>


<ul>

<li><strong>Change your user IDs and passwords.</strong> We encourage you to make a practice of regularly changing your user IDs and passwords, as well as your security questions and answers.</li>
<li><strong>Use unique and complex passwords.</strong> Always use unique passwords for your CRA and online banking accounts. Do not reuse the same password for different accounts or systems.</li>
<li><strong>Create a PIN. </strong>We suggest you&nbsp;set up a personal identification number (PIN) for your individual account to help confirm your identity for future calls with the CRA. You can set up a PIN in My Account or with the help of one of our general enquiries call centre agents.</li>
<li><strong>Make sure your personal and business information is up to date.</strong> The CRA may need to contact you to validate certain activities on your account that may be suspicious.</li>
<li>If you are a business owner, <strong>verify the applicable federal, provincial, or territorial corporate registry</strong> to make sure that the list of directors and contact information are correct.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="h3">If your account is compromised</h2>

<p>If you notice changes to your CRA account information that you did not request, or if you think information has been compromised, you should report it to the CRA. This can include communication from the CRA regarding changes to your account that you did not authorize. </p>
<p>If you believe your My Account, My Business Account or Represent a Client account(s) have been compromised, please <a href="report-scams.html">Report a scam or identity theft to the CRA</a>. </p>
<p>The CRA does send letters by registered mail to individuals and businesses affected by incidents of suspected unauthorized access. If you receive a letter notifying you that your account has been compromised, follow the instructions in the letter.</p>

<h3>What the CRA will do</h3>
<p>If your account information has been compromised, your online CRA account(s) may have been accessed by an unauthorized individual. As a result, the CRA will take the following actions.</p>
<p>If you are an individual, we will:</p>
<ul>
<li>disable access to your account(s) and you will receive a call or letter with instructions on how to validate your identity to regain access</li>
<li>assess whether you are entitiled to be offered credit protection services free of charge</li>
<li>temporarily stop sending any benefit and credit payments to you until your identity has been validated and access to your account has been restored</li>
<li>work with you to restore your personal information and ensure you are not held liable for fraudulent claims and payments made on your account (this includes ensuring fraudulent claims do not impact you next tax filing season)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are a business, we:</p>
<ul>
<li>may temporarily stop payments to your business pending validation of your account</li>
<li>may disable any applicable web access codes which allow for electronic filing of information returns</li>
<li>will work with you to re-activate your business account, resume payments intended for your business and request new access codes, if applicable</li>
<li>will notify you if the personal information of your employees may have been accessed without authorization</li>
</ul>

<h3>How the CRA will contact you</h3>
<p>As soon as the CRA becomes aware of an alleged incident of identity theft or suspects an account could be the target of a bad actor, we take swift and immediate precautionary measures.</p>

 
    
        <h4>Incidents of suspected unauthorized access</h4>
<p>We send letters by mail to individuals and businesses who have been affected by unauthorized access.</p>
<p>The letter provides information on how to validate your identity to restore access to your account, and how we are helping those affected by these incidents. For individuals, this may include access to free credit protection services.</p>

    

    
        <h4>Suspected identity theft</h4>
<p>In cases of suspected identify theft, we may call you or write you a letter asking for details about your file and request documents to validate your identity and personal information.</p>
<p>This could include a:</p>
<ul>
<li>copy of government identification (such as a driver’s license, passport, or birth certificate)</li>
<li>proof of address (such as a utility, phone, or internet bill, or tax-related document)</li>
<li>bank statement or letter from financial institution confirming your direct deposit information</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re suspicious about a call or letter that you’ve received that is requesting information from you, here’s how to <a href="verify-cra-contact.html">verify it's the CRA contacting you</a>.</p>
