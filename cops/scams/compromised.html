<p>If you suspect unauthorized access or notice changes to your CRA account without your approval, you should report it to the CRA.  This includes if you received a communication from the CRA stating a change was made to your account that you did not approve.  </p>
<p>If you believe your My Account, My Business Account or Represent a Client account(s) have been compromised, please <a href="report-scams.html">report a scam or identity theft to the CRA</a>. </p>
<p>The CRA does send letters by registered mail to individuals and businesses affected by incidents of suspected unauthorized access. If you receive a letter notifying you that your account has been compromised, follow the instructions in the letter.</p>
<h2 id="h1">Actions taken by the CRA</h2>

<p>If your account information has been compromised, the CRA will take the following actions.</p>
<h4>For individuals, we may:</h4>
<ul>
<li>temporarily disable access to your account(s)</li>
	<li>contact you by phone or letter with instructions on how to validate your identity to regain account access</li>
	
<li>assess whether you are entitiled to be offered credit protection services free of charge</li>
<li>temporarily stop sending any benefit and credit payments to you until your identity has been validated</li>
<li>work with you to restore your personal information and ensure you are not held liable for fraudulent claims and payments made on your account</li>
</ul>
<h3>For businesses, we may:</h3>
	 
<ul>
<li>temporarily stop payments</li>
<li>disable web access codes for electronic filing</li>
<li>work with businesses to reactivate accounts, resume payments, and issue new access codes if needed</li>
<li>notify you if the personal information of your employees may have been accessed without authorization</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h2">Communications sent from the CRA</h2>
<p>As soon as the CRA becomes aware of an alleged incident of identity theft or suspects an account could be the target of a bad actor, we take swift and immediate precautionary measures.</p>

 
    
        <h3>Incidents of suspected unauthorized access</h3>
<p>We send letters by mail to individuals and businesses who have been affected by unauthorized access.</p>
<p>The letter provides information on how to validate your identity to restore access to your account, and how we are helping those affected by these incidents. For individuals, this may include access to free credit protection services.</p>

    

    
        <h3>Suspected identity theft</h3>
<p>In cases of suspected identify theft, we may call you or write you a letter asking for details about your file and request documents to validate your identity and personal information.</p>
<p>This could include a:</p>
<ul>
<li>copy of government identification (such as a driver’s license, passport, or birth certificate)</li>
<li>proof of address (such as a utility, phone, or internet bill, or tax-related document)</li>
<li>bank statement or letter from financial institution confirming your direct deposit information</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re suspicious about a call or letter that you’ve received that is requesting information from you, here’s how to <a href="verify-cra-contact.html">verify it's the CRA contacting you</a>.</p>
