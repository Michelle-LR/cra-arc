	<h3>How we will address your feedback</h3>
	<p>On July 11, 2019, the <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/a-0.6/?wbdisable=false">Accessible Canada Act (ACA)</a> came into force, making due on the government of Canada’s commitment to furthering the rights of persons with disabilities.</p>
<p>Promoting and advancing accessibility is about creating barrier-free communities, workplaces and services for all Canadians, especially those who have a disability.</p>
<p>The CRA is fully committed to proactive identification, removal and prevention of barriers for all Canadians.</p>
<p>Your feedback will be taken into account as part of the continuous improvement of our accessibility efforts.</p>
<p>Some feedback may be addressed right away, and some may be addressed in the continued development of our accessibility plan. The feedback we receive and how we take it into consideration will be included in our progress reports.&nbsp;</p>
