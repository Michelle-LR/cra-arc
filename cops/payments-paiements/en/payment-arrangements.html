  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-8">
      <p>When you arrange to pay any existing debt over time, you are entering into a payment arrangement. A payment arrangement is an agreement you make with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA). It allows you to make smaller payments over time until you have paid your entire debt including applicable interest.</p>

        <h2 id="partial">Making a partial payment towards your debt</h2>
        
          <p>Making a <strong>partial payment</strong> to the CRA still requires you to <a href="#entering">enter into a payment arrangement</a>.</p>
       
        <h2 id="entering">Entering into a payment arrangement</h2>
        <p>Before you make a payment arrangement, you may need to show that you or your business has tried to pay your debt in full by borrowing money or reducing your expenses. To figure out your ability to pay, we may ask you to provide proof of your income, expenses, assets, and liabilities. You may have to do this by telephone or by completing a financial questionnaire.</p>

        <p>Before you determine the amount and the frequency to be paid, the <a href="https://apps.cra-arc.gc.ca/ebci/recc/pac/updateNetIncome.action?request_locale=en_CA">Personal income and expense worksheet</a> is a helpful budget tool to help you determine what you can afford to pay on a regular basis.</p>

        <p>You must pay as agreed, continue to file all returns on time, and stay up to date with your tax obligations. Payment arrangements may be subject to periodic reviews.</p>
