<p>Content has been updated to include the <strong>new CRA administrative policy</strong>. This change is <strong>effective January 1, 2024</strong> and is identified with the tag <span class="label label-warning">New CRA administrative policy</span>.</p>
</div>



<p>When you pay employment income such as salaries, wages, or commissions, the employee's province or territory of employment (POE) must be determined so that the proper deductions are withheld. This depends on whether your employee “reports for work” at any of your establishments.</p>
			 <p>The POE is <strong>determined by</strong>:</p>
			 
			<ul>
	<li>the type of income</li>
				 <li >the residency status</li>
				 <li >how the employee reports for work</li>
		   </ul>
<p>For income tax, CPP and EI withholding purposes, an <strong>establishment of the employer</strong> is <strong>any place or premises in Canada </strong>that is owned, leased or rented by an employer where employees report to work or from which employees are paid. For purposes of the POE, <strong>this does not need to be a permanent physical location</strong>.</p>

              <div id="ajax-agreement">
<p>Generally, the CRA considers a full-time remote work agreement to include <strong>both </strong>temporary and permanent arrangements where an employer <strong>directs or allows </strong>employees to perform their usual employment duties at an approved location away from the regular workplace.</p>

                    <h4 class="text-muted">Worker may be a full-time remote worker</h4>
<p>The following sectors have high rates of employee's working remotely:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Professional and technical services</strong> - For example: accounting, bookkeeping, consulting, legal, advertising, information technology (IT) or computer related services </li>
<li><strong>Public administration</strong> - For example: federal, provincial, territorial, municipal, or regional administration </li>
<li><strong>Information, culture and recreation</strong> - For example: Publishing industries, telecommunication, broadcasting or data processing </li>
<li><strong>Financial and insurance</strong> - For example: Central bank, insurance, securities, funds or other financial activities </li>
<li><strong>Employees working on the road</strong> - For example: representatives or vendors </li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>This is because employees may still perform their jobs reasonably well outside the workplace.</p>
</li>
 <li class="cnjnctn-col">
                    <h4 class="text-muted">Worker may not be a full-time remote worker</h4>
<p>The following sectors have lower rates of employee's working remotely:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Accommodation and food services</strong> - For example: hotels, resorts, bed and breakfast, recreational vehicle parks or coupgrounds</li>
<li><strong>Construction services</strong> - For example: construction of buildings</li>
<li><strong>Retail trade</strong> - For example: motor vehicle dealers, furniture stores, electronic and appliance stores or food stores</li>
<li><strong>Health care and social assistance</strong> - For example: hospitals, nursing and residential care facilities or social assistance</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>This is because employees may require more person-to-person contact, working with large machinery or have a limited scope for remote work because of different factors.</p>

<p class="mrgn-bttm-md"> <strong>This determination must be done based on a thorough review of the facts in each specific case.</strong></p>

<h4 class="mrgn-tp-lg">Significant factor</h4>
<p>The establishment where the employee would physically come to work in person to carry out the functions related to their employment duties. </p>
<p>For employees who physically reported to an establishment of the employer <strong>immediately before </strong>entering a full-time remote work agreement, that establishment is the one to which they would be considered to be attached. </p>
<h4>Secondary factors </h4>
<p>You may also need to consider the following secondary factors when determining where the employee is considered to be "attached to an establishment" of the employer:</p>

<ol>
<li>The establishment where the employee would physically attend meetings, through any type of communication </li>
<li>The establishment where the employee would physically receive work-related material or equipment or associated instructions and assistance </li>
<li>The establishment where the employee would physically come in person to receive instructions from their employer regarding their duties, through any type of communication </li>
<li>The establishment that is responsible for the employee, as indicated in the contractual agreements between the employer and the employee </li>
<li>The establishment of the employer to which they would report based on the nature of the duties performed by the employee </li>
</ol>
<p class="mrgn-tp-md">Generally, <strong>each factor </strong>needs to be viewed as a whole in order to help you determine where the employee is considered to be "attached to an establishment". You will normally have more than 1 factor when determining where the employee is considered "attached" to a specific establishment of the employer.</p>

<details><summary><strong>More than 1 establishment</strong> of the employer</summary>
<p>If your employee can be reasonably considered attached to <strong>more than 1 establishment of the employer, </strong>the same factors should be used. The establishment of the employer would be <strong>either:</strong></p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">where they would be <strong>spending most time</strong> </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">where they would be <strong>working last</strong>, if the employee would be reporting to each establishment for the same amount of time </li>
