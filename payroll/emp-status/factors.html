<div id="ajax-step2">
  <p>You need to <a href="#ajax-contract" aria-controls="ajax-contract" class="overlay-lnk" role="button">review the contract <span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a> to determine the intent of the parties (both the worker and the payer), when they entered into the working arrangement.

<p>Workers and payers can choose how they set up their affairs. However, the working status they choose must reflect their working relationship. When reviewing the employment status, you need to consider all the facts, <strong>not</strong> just their intention in making the contract.

  <li>  <h3 id="step3">Gather all facts to determine the status of the worker</h3>

  <p>Once you completed your <a href="#ajax-contract" aria-controls="ajax-contract" class="overlay-lnk" role="button">review of the contract <span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a> to determine the intent of the parties, you need to gather all the facts to help you determine the status of the worker.</p>

<li class="cnjnctn-col">A self-employed worker (a person in business on their own account)</li>

<p>The following indicators for <strong>each factor</strong> need to be viewed as a whole in order to help you decide. This also needs to be done on a <strong>case-by-case basis</strong>. This can change when the terms and conditions of the relationship changes.</p>

 <ol class="lst-stps-sub stps-strpd ld-zr">
<li> <h4 id="factor2">Control over the worker</h4>
      <p>Control is the ability, authority, or right of a payer to exercise control over a worker concerning the manner in which the work is done and what work will be done. </p>
<p>Consider the degree of control held by the payer or the degree of independence held by the worker. The actual degree of control will vary with the type of work and the skills of the worker. </p>
<details><summary>Reviewing the degree of control for professionals</summary>
<p>Generally, it is difficult to review the degree of control for professionals like engineers, doctors, and IT consultants. These experts, due to their training, might not need much specific direction in their work. When reviewing the factor of control, we should look at both the payer's control over the worker's daily tasks and their influence over the worker.</p>
<p>The right of the payer to exercise control is very important when reviewing the degree of control for professionals and not necessarily whether they actively use that right.</p>

<li><h4 id="factor3">Ownership of the tools and equipment</h4>
      <p id="3">Consider if the worker owns and provides tools and equipment to accomplish the work. Contractual control of, and responsibility for, an asset in a rental or lease situation is also considered under this factor.</p>
      <details>
        <summary>What is considered a significant investment</summary>
        <p>What is relevant is the significant investment in the tools and equipment along with the cost of replacement, repair, and insurance. A worker who has made a significant investment is likely to retain a right over the use of these assets, diminishing the payer's control over how the work is carried out. In addition, such a significant investment may place the worker at a risk of a financial loss.</p>
        <p>Tools and equipment can vary widely in terms of value and can include everything from wrenches and hammers, to specialized clothing, appliances, stethoscopes, musical instruments, computers, and vehicles such as trucks and tractors.</p>
        <p>Self-employed workers often supply the tools and equipment required for a contract. As a result, the ownership of tools and equipment by a worker is more commonly associated with a business relationship.</p>
        <p>However, employees sometimes also have to provide their own tools. The courts have acknowledged that because a worker is required to provide tools of the trade, this does not in itself mean that the worker is a self-employed worker. For example, many skilled tradespeople such as auto mechanics have to supply their own tools, even if they are full-time employees.</p>

<li><h4 id="factor7">Opportunity for profit</h4>
      <p id="7">Consider whether the worker can realize a profit or incur a loss, as this indicates that a worker controls the business aspects of services rendered and that a business relationship likely exists. To have a chance of a profit and a risk of a loss, a worker has to have potential proceeds and expenses, and one could exceed the other.</p>
      <details>
        <summary>Consider this factor from the worker's perspective</summary>
        <p>This factor has to be considered from the worker's perspective, not the payer's. It is for the most part an assessment of the degree to which the worker can control their proceeds and expenses.</p>
        <p>Employees normally do not have the chance of a profit and risk of a loss even though their remuneration can vary depending on the terms of their employment contracts. For example, employees working on a commission or piece-rate basis, or employees with a productivity bonus clause in their contract can increase their earnings based on their productivity. This increase in income is not normally viewed as a profit, as it is not the excess of proceeds over expenses.</p>
        <p>Employees may have expenses directly related to their employment, such as automobile expenses, and board and lodging costs. Normally, expenses would not place employees at risk of incurring a loss because it is unlikely that the expenses would be greater than their remuneration.</p>
        <p>Self-employed workers normally have the chance of profit or risk of loss, because they have the ability to pursue and accept contracts as they see fit. They can negotiate the price (or unilaterally set their prices) for their services and have the right to offer those services to more than one payer. Self-employed workers will normally incur expenses to carry out the terms and conditions of their contracts, and to manage those expenses to maximize net earnings. Self-employed workers can increase their proceeds and/or decrease their expenses in an effort to increase profit.</p>
        <p>Employees generally do not share in profits or suffer losses incurred by the payer's business.</p>
        <p>The method of payment may help to decide if the worker has the opportunity to make a profit or incur a loss. In an employer-employee relationship, the worker is normally guaranteed a return for the work done and is usually paid on an hourly, daily, weekly, or similar basis.</p>
        <p>Similarly, some self-employed workers are paid on an hourly basis. However, when a worker is paid a flat rate for the work done, it generally indicates a business relationship, especially if the worker incurs expenses in doing the work.</p>

  <h3 id="step4">Do a final analysis based on all factors reviewed</h3>
  
    <h4 id="analyze">Analyze the facts</h4>
    <p>You need to analyze the facts by organizing and assessing the information you gathered. This process will show if the facts of the working relationship match the status the parties have chosen and are consistent with the common law understanding of employment and self-employment. In brief, it will clarify if there is an employment relationship, or if the worker is in business on their own account.</p>

    <p>You must analyze the answer to each question from both the payer’s <strong>and</strong> the worker’s perspective to help you decide on the worker’s employment status.</p>
   
    <h4 id="weight">Weighing the facts</h4>
   <p>This is the most important part of analyzing the information. When reviewing the factors, there may be some facts that support an employee-employer relationship and other facts indicate self-employment.</p>

    <p>To help you resolve this issue, you must determine the true essence of the working relationship of the parties, comparing the intentions of the parties to the facts of the working relationship. You must review the indicators in the factors of control, ownership of tools and equipment, opportunity for profit and financial risk, and responsibility for investment and management. As you review each question and response, you should be able to decide what weight to assign each indicator based on a thorough review of all the responses. For example, control may favour an employee relationship, but ownership of tools may be assigned <strong>more weight </strong>due to how the total relationship is structured. This may be an indicator because of the increased weight given to this factor, that the worker is self-employed.</p>

    <h4 id="case">Review each situation on a case-by-case basis</h4>
    <p>Whether a worker is an employee or self-employed needs to be analyzed on a case-by-case basis. Each case is unique and requires a thorough review of the facts. It is also important to remember that when attempting to decide the employment status, you must examine the <strong>total working relationship</strong>. There is no one factor that is determinative, and there is a non-exhaustive list of factors to consider.</p>

  <h3 id="step5b">Do a final analysis based on all factors reviewed</h3>
 <h4 id="analyzeb">Analyze the facts</h4>
    <p>You need to analyze the facts by organizing and assessing the information you gathered. This process will show if the facts of the working relationship match the status the parties have chosen and are consistent with the definitions of the <abbr title="Civil Code of Quebec">C.C.Q.</abbr>. Generally, it will clarify if there is an employment relationship, or if the worker is in business on their own account.</p>

    <p>You must analyze the answer to each question from both the payer’s <strong>and</strong> the worker’s perspective to help you decide on the worker’s employment status.</p>
   
    <h4 id="weightb">Weighing the facts</h4>
   <p>This is the most important part of analyzing the information. When reviewing the factors, there may be some facts that support an employee-employer relationship and other facts indicate self-employment.</p>

    <p>To help you resolve this issue, you must determine the true essence of the working relationship of the parties, comparing the intentions of the parties to the facts of their working relationship. You must review the indicators in the factors of carrying out the work, remuneration and relationship of subordination As you review each question and response, you should be able to decide what weight to assign each indicator based on a thorough review of all the responses. For example, one fact may favour an employee relationship, but another may be assigned <strong>more weight</strong> due to how the relationship is structured. This may be an indicator, because of the increased weight given to this factor, that the worker is self-employed.</p>

    <h4 id="caseb">Review each situation on a case-by-case basis</h4>
    <p>Whether a worker is an employee or self-employed needs to be analyzed on a case-by-case basis. Each case is unique and requires a thorough review of the facts. It is also important to remember that when attempting to decide the employment status, you must review the understanding a contract of employment and contract for services of the <abbr title="Civil Code of Quebec">C.C.Q.</abbr>.</p>
