<p>The analysis to determine if a worker is an employee or self-employed is also relevant to determine whether the corporation of an employee who provides services through a corporation meets the conditions for being considered a <abbr title="Personal service business">PSB</abbr> for corporate income tax purposes.</p>

<p>It is important to recognize that employment status and whether a corporation meets the conditions to be considered a PSB are distinct determinations and are made under different legislation. </p>

<p>While the analysis of whether an incorporated employee would have been an employee but for the existence of the corporation is fundamentally the same as whether a worker is an employee or self-employed, a <strong>CPP/EI Ruling cannot be requested to determine if a corporation meets this requirement</strong>.

 <h4>Examples</h4> 
<details><summary>Example: <strong>Does not</strong> meet the conditions</summary>
 <h5>Description</h5> 
<p>Faye is looking to create her own coding and consulting business. She creates a business plan with a couple of friends, and incorporates as 123 Programming Inc. Faye and her two friends become shareholders of the business.</p>
<p>To perform work, Faye and her business partners use the corporation’s computer equipment. Throughout the first fiscal year, the corporation worked for five clients, billed the clients, and disbursed a portion of the payment to the shareholders, while also holding a small portion to pay off corporation expenses.&nbsp; The work they performed ranged from coding an appointment registration application for a hair salon, to consulting with a mall on how to update their networking infrastructure.</p>
 <h5>Result</h5> 
<p>In this example, 123 Programming Inc. does not meet the conditions to be considered a <abbr title="Personal service business">PSB</abbr>, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Faye and her business partners perform work for clients using 123 Programming Inc.’s equipment, but they do not perform work that an employee of their clients would normally perform</li>
<li>123 Programming’s income is from services performed by more than one shareholder for more than one client</li>
</ul>
<p>Since 123 Programming Inc. is not considered a <abbr title="Personal service business">PSB</abbr>, the same tax obligations apply as any other corporations.</p>
    </details>

 <details class="mrgn-bttm-md"><summary>Examples: Meets the conditions</summary>
  <h4>Example 1</h4>   
  <h5>Description</h5>  
<p>Tam is looking for a job. An Ontario-based trucking company (ABC Trucking) offers him a 12-month position with full-time hours. The contract comes with the stipulation that Tam perform his services through a corporation.</p>
<p>Tam incorporates his business (858689 Ontario Inc.), for which he is the only shareholder and the only employee. 858689 Ontario Inc.’s only client is ABC Trucking.</p>
<p>858689 Ontario Inc. bills ABC Trucking for the services it performs, and it receives payment from ABC Trucking for those services. 858689 Ontario Inc. either keeps the funds in the corporation or disburses them to Tam.</p>
 <h5>Result</h5>  
<p>In this example, 858689 Ontario Inc. meets the conditions to be considered a <abbr title="Personal service business">PSB</abbr> because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tam is a specified shareholder of 858689 Ontario Inc.</li>
<li>Tam performs the work of an ABC Trucking employee using their trucks, and were it not for the existence of 858689 Ontario Inc., Tam would be considered an employee of ABC Trucking</li>
<li>858689 Ontario Inc.’s sole income is from services performed by Tam (incorporated employee) for ABC Trucking</li>
</ul> 

<h4>Example 2</h4>   
  <h5>Description</h5>  
  <p>Mia is a nail technician and is looking for a job. A nail salon, 789 Salon, offers her a job but requires Mia to incorporate in order to offer her services at their salon. Mia incorporates as XYZ Nails Inc. and is the only shareholder and employee. She pays a chair rental fee to 789 Salon.</p>
<p>The hiring business, 789 Salon, supplies all the instruments and products required to perform her job as a nail technician.</p>
 <h5>Result</h5>  
<p>In this example, XYZ Nails Inc. meets the conditions to be considered a <abbr title="Personal service business">PSB</abbr> because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mia is a specified shareholder of XYZ Nails Inc. and its only employee</li>
<li>Mia performs the work of a 789 Salon employee using their instruments and products, and were it not for the existence of XYZ Nails Inc., Mia would be considered an employee of 789 Salon</li>
<li>XYZ Nails Inc.’s sole income is from services performed by Mia (incorporated employee) for 789 Salon</li>
</ul>
<p>Should the conditions of Mia’s business change to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using her own equipment and products</li>
<li>Making her own appointments</li>
<li>Advertising XYZ Nails Inc. business</li>
<li>Hiring other manicurists to sit in her chair at 789 Salon</li>
</ul>
<p>It would be more likely that she would not be considered a <abbr title="Personal service business">PSB</abbr> for income tax purposes.</p>
