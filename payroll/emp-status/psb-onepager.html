                <summary>How to determine if the worker would be considered an employee</summary>
                <p>One of the conditions for a corporation to be a <abbr title="Personal service business">PSB</abbr> is that the incorporated employee that provides services to the person on behalf of the corporation <strong>would reasonably be considered an employee of that person if the corporation did not exist</strong>.</p>
                <h4><span class="fas fa-ban text-danger fa-lg"> </span> You <strong>cannot</strong> ask for a CPP/EI ruling to determine if the corporation meets the requirements to be considered a <strong>PSB</strong></h4>
                <p>The analysis to determine if a worker is an employee or self-employed is also used to determine whether the corporation of an employee who provides services through a corporation meets this condition for being considered a PSB for corporate income tax purposes.</p>
                <p>It is important to recognize that employment status and whether a corporation meets the conditions to be considered a PSB are distinct determinations and are made under different legislation. All factors used to determine whether an employee-employer relationship exists are the same factors used to determine whether a worker would have been an employee if the corporation did not exist.</p>
                <p>While the analysis of whether an incorporated employee would have been an employee but for the existence of the corporation is fundamentally the same as whether a worker is an employee or self-employed, a <strong>CPP/EI ruling cannot be requested to determine if a corporation meets this requirement</strong>. However, a worker who provides services for a PSB can request a ruling as to whether they are an employee of the PSB or are self-employed.</p>
                <p>If you determine that the <strong>worker would be considered an employee and meets the other conditions above, the worker is also considered a <abbr title="Personal service business">PSB</abbr>.</strong></p>

            <p>Faye is looking to create her own coding and consulting business. She creates a business plan with a couple of friends, and incorporates as 123 Programming Inc. Faye and her two friends become shareholders of the business.</p>
            <p>To perform work, Faye and her business partners use the corporation’s computer equipment. Throughout the first fiscal year, the corporation worked for five clients, billed the clients, and disbursed a portion of the payment to the shareholders, while also holding a small portion to pay off corporation expenses.&nbsp; The work they performed ranged from coding an appointment registration application for a hair salon, to consulting with a mall on how to update their networking infrastructure.</p>
            <h5>Result</h5>
            <p>In this example, 123 Programming Inc. does not meet the conditions to be considered a <abbr title="Personal service business">PSB</abbr>, because:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Faye and her business partners perform work for clients using 123 Programming Inc.’s equipment, but they do not perform work that an employee of their clients would normally perform</li>

            </ul>

            <p>Tam is looking for a job. An Ontario-based trucking company (ABC Trucking) offers him a 12-month position with full-time hours. The contract comes with the stipulation that Tam perform his services through a corporation.</p>
            <p>Tam incorporates his business (858689 Ontario Inc.), for which he is the only shareholder and the only employee. 858689 Ontario Inc.’s only client is ABC Trucking.</p>
            <p>858689 Ontario Inc. bills ABC Trucking for the services it performs, and it receives payment from ABC Trucking for those services. 858689 Ontario Inc. either keeps the funds in the corporation or disburses them to Tam.</p>
            <h5>Result</h5>
            <p>In this example, 858689 Ontario Inc. meets the conditions to be considered a <abbr title="Personal service business">PSB</abbr> because:</p>

            <p>The hiring business, 789 Salon, supplies all the instruments and products required to perform her job as a nail technician.</p>
            <h5>Result</h5>
