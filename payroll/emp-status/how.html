<p>There must be a contract in place to see whether the worker is considered an employee or self-employed. This guidance on employment status assumes <strong>there is, or will be, a contract in place</strong>.</p>

<p>Contracts can be formed either orally or in writing. An oral contract is as valid and enforceable as a written contract.</p>

<p>The CRA may request a copy of the written contract or testimony by the parties to review the parties's actions. This review is to identify the intentions of both parties in the context of the employment. While this agreement is important, the facts of the working relationship <strong>as a whole</strong> will determine the employment status and not the wording of the contract alone.</p>

<p>Generally, all of the following elements apply when a contract is valid:</p>

<details><summary>Who decides when a contract is null and void</summary>
<p>When addressing the issue of statutory illegality, the courts can decide that a contract is null and void from the beginning (void ab initio) if the formation of the contract was prohibited by statute and if, in the court's assessment, it would not be contrary to public policy to declare the contract void ab initio.</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Examples of termination of a contract</summary>
<p>The following are examples of when a contract is terminated:</p>
<ul>
<li>The death of one of the parties</li>
<li>The expiry of the time stipulated for the duration of the contract by the parties or by law (in the absence of any by the parties) </li>
<li>Confusion arising as a result of both parties to the contract becoming one in the same (for example, an individual buys a business (sole proprietorship) that they have an existing contract with and becomes both parties to the same contract) </li>
<li>Misrepresentation </li>
<li>Fraud </li>
<li>Duress </li>
<li>The effect of a resolutory clause in the contract (this would be a clause in the contract that serves to release the parties to the contract from an obligation in the event of a stipulated occurrence or series of events)</li>
<li>The disrespect of the main clauses of the contract, or significant breach of the conditions outlined in the contract </li>
<li>A judgment from a competent court</li>
<li>When the performance required by the contract becomes impossible for one or more of the parties to the contract to honour (reasons such as a change in law making it illegal for one of the parties to meet their obligations, or the physical incapacity (injury or mental illness) of one or more of the parties can cause a contract to become impossible to honour)</li>
<li>When both the obligations and the consideration set out in the contract have been satisfied (once a contract is completed, it is at its cessation) </li>
</ul>
</details>

<h3>Types of contracts under the law</h3>
<p>The main types of employment contracts are:</p>
 <ul class="fa-ul">
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li fa-lg text-success"> </span> Contracts of service (COS) - Employer/employee relationship</li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li fa-lg text-success"> </span> Contracts for service (CFS) - Worker is self-employed or a contractor</li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li fa-lg text-success"> </span> Contracts sui generis (of their own kind) - Elements found in both a COS and in a CFS</li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li fa-lg text-success"> </span> Contracts of apprenticeship - Contractual relationship with an employer for the purpose of learning a trade or occupation</li>
</ul>

<details><summary>What is <strong>not</strong> considered an employer/employee relationship</summary>
<p>The following are not considered an employer/employee relationship because they are designed for other purposes than to earn the worker’s livelihood:</p>
 <ul class="fa-ul">
<li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-lg fa-li"></span>  Volunteering arrangements</li>
<li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-lg fa-li"></span>  Rehabilitation and reintegration programs</li>
</ul>
<p>If your situation is unique and different from regular employment or self-employment, you can ask for a CPP/EI ruling. </p>

</details>
<h3>Factors to consider based on where the contract was made </h3>	
<p>You need to review the contract to determine in which province it was formed in because the multiple factors to consider are different.</p>
<p>The factors to consider are based on where the contract was made, unless the contract says otherwise.</p>

<details><summary>What if the parties are <strong>not</strong> located in the same province</summary>
<p>When the parties involved in a contract are not in the same province or territory, multiple factors determine which jurisdiction's laws and regulations apply to the contract. </p>
<p>The most common factors include the following:</p>
 <ul class="fa-ul">
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li fa-lg text-success"> </span> The province or territory where the contract is considered to have been formed is significant</li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li fa-lg text-success"> </span> Where the parties have explicitly chosen the legal framework (the contract itself may specify which jurisdiction's laws should govern the agreement)</li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li fa-lg text-success"> </span> The provincial and territorial laws often have rules for determining which jurisdiction's laws apply in the absence of a specific choice of law in the contract</li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li fa-lg text-success"> </span> The jurisdiction where the offeror (the party making the initial offer) receives acceptance of the contract may be considered the jurisdiction where the contract was formed (where the parties negotiated the contract through methods like telephone, fax, or email)</li>
</ul>
