<p>The analysis to determine if a worker is an employee or self-employed is also relevant to determine whether the corporation of an employee who provides services through a corporation meets the conditions for being considered a <abbr title="Personal service business">PSB</abbr> for corporate income tax purposes.</p>

<p>While the analysis of whether an incorporated employee would have been an employee but for the existence of the corporation is fundamentally the same as whether a worker is an employee or self-employed, a <strong>CPP/EI Ruling cannot be requested to determine if a corporation meets this requirement</strong>. However, a worker who provides services for a <abbr title="Personal service business">PSB</abbr> can request a ruling as to whether they are an employee of the PSB or are self-employed.</p>
