<div data-ajax-replace="/cra-arc/payroll/emp-status/factors-psb.html#ajax-psbinfo"></div>

<p>If your businesses hires or you operate a personal services business, your tax obligations are different.</p>
<p>The CRA might consider your corporation to be a personal services business if all conditions are met.</p>
<p>In other words, an individual who chooses to incorporate their business in order to provide services for one other business might be considered to be operating a personal services business.</p>
<p>In this case, the company receiving the services would be considered the payer &ndash; a person or company who pays the worker or corporation for their services.</p>
<p>And the Personal Service Business receiving payment for those services would be considered the payee.</p>


<p>When determining if a corporation is a personal services business or incorporated employee, we generally apply the similar logic used when determining if an individualis an employee or self employed. </p>
<p>When a PSB exists, there is typically a level of subordination, similar to that of an employee.</p>
<p>It is important to note that workers and payers are free to set their affairs as they wish, but they must make sure that whatever status they have chosen is supported by the actual facts of the working relationship.</p>
<p>In some industries, such as the following, it is a more common practice for payers to require individuals to incorporate in order to provide services:</p>

<ul>
<li>Real estate, rental and leasing </li>
<li>Construction </li>
<li>Trucking </li>
<li>Transportation and warehousing </li>
<li>Professional, scientific, and technical services </li>
</ul>
