<h2 id="h_1">What is a PSB</h2>	
<p>The CRA is working to help Canadian corporations operating as <abbr title="Personal service business">PSB</abbr> and the businesses that hire them to better understand their tax obligations.</p>
<div id="ajax-psbinfo"> 
<p>Generally, a <abbr title="Personal service business">PSB</abbr> exists where the person performing the work would be considered to be an employee of the payer if it were not for the existence of the corporation through which they are performing the services.</p>
  </div>
<p>The CRA might consider your corporation to be a <abbr title="Personal service business">PSB</abbr> if <strong>all 5 conditions for a corporation to be a <abbr title="Personal service business">PSB</abbr> are met</strong>. If they are not met and you provided your services through a corporation, the same tax obligations will apply to you as to any other corporation.</p>

<p>If the person is <strong>not</strong> performing the services through a corporation, they are <strong>not</strong> operating a <abbr title="Personal service business">PSB</abbr> and you should review their employment status to determine your tax obligations.</p>

<h2 id="h_2">Payer and payee relationship</h2>	
<p>If your businesses hires or you operate a <abbr title="Personal service business">PSB</abbr>, your tax obligations are different from those of an employer and employee.</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><h4>Payer</h4>	<p>The business receiving the services is considered the payer (a person or business who pays the worker or corporation for their services).</p></li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><h4>Payee</h4> <p>The <abbr title="Personal service business">PSB</abbr> receiving the payment for those services is considered the payee.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h_3">Why is it important to determine if the corporation is a PSB</h2>	
<p>It is important to determine if the corporation is a <abbr title="Personal service business">PSB</abbr> because special rules may apply to their corporation for income tax purposes if a worker performs the services on behalf of their own corporation. </p>
<p>For example, a <abbr title="Personal service business">PSB</abbr> is not eligible for the general tax reduction or the small business reduction, which allow other corporations to reduce their corporate tax rates. They are also limited in the expenses they may deduct from their income.</p>
<h3 id="h_4">Example of common types of industries</h3>	
<p>In some industries, such as the following, it is a more common practice for payers to require individuals to incorporate in order to provide services:</p>

<ul>
<li>Real estate, rental and leasing </li>
<li>Construction </li>
<li>Trucking </li>
<li>Transportation and warehousing </li>
<li>Professional, scientific, and technical services </li>
</ul>

<p>In other words, a person who chooses to incorporate their business in order to provide services for one other business might be considered to be operating a <abbr title="Personal service business">PSB</abbr>.</p>

<h2 id="h_4">Help for small businesses</h2>
<p>Small businesses that would like help in understanding their tax obligations can ask for a visit from a Canada Revenue Agency Liaison Officer. </p>

<h3 id="h_1-1">More help if you are a personal services business (PSB)</h3>
<p>The CRA is conducting an educational outreach project to help industries that hire or operate a <abbr title="Personal service business">PSB</abbr> understand and comply with their tax obligations associated with this type of arrangement.</p>
<p>Learn more on the results from phase 1 of the <abbr title="Personal service business">PSB</abbr> pilot: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/corporations/corporation-income-tax-return/personal-services-business-pilot.html">Personal services business pilot</a></p>
<p>The results from phase 1 of the <abbr title="Personal service business">PSB</abbr> pilot will help develop the next phases.</p>
