<h2 id="2A">Payroll obligations </h2>
<p>Generally, any person must open a payroll account, calculate payroll deductions and contributions, remit (pay) deductions and contributions, and file information returns if they make payments to a self-employed worker.</p>

<p>Depending on <strong>who the payment is made to</strong>, the payer may have withhold and remit the income tax, EI, CPP or GST/HST on payments made related to the provision of services to a PSB.</p>

<p>Generally, if the payer makes a payment for a service outside of an employment relationship or tenure of office, the payer <strong>must</strong> fill out a T4A slip. This includes payments of fees for services between businesses, including sole proprietors and corporations. Depending on the situation, the payer may need to fill out a T4A-NR, T5018 or T1204 instead.</p>
