        <p>Depending on your business, a change of owners, partners or directors may require different actions, such as changing legal names or registering a new business number and new program accounts.</p>

</ul>

    
        <h2 id="sole_proprietorship">Sole proprietorship</h2>
<p>A sole proprietorship is legally and directly tied to one specific individual. If you sell or stop operating your business, you <strong>must</strong> close your business <span class="nowrap">number (BN)</span> and all your&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>&nbsp;program accounts&nbsp;by calling us <span class="nowrap">at <strong>1-800-959-5525</strong>.</span></p>
<p>A new owner can't continue using the old <abbr title="business number">BN</abbr>. They will have to get a new <abbr title="business number">BN</abbr> and new program accounts for the business.&nbsp;For more information, go to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/taxes/business-number.html">Business number</a>.</p>
 <h3>Non-resident of Canada</h3>
<p>If you are a sole proprietor who is a <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> of Canada or you have a <span class="nowrap">social insurance number</span> beginning <span class="nowrap">with a 9 or a 0,</span> go to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information/non-resident-gst-hst-enquiries.html">Non-resident GST/HST Enquiries</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="partnership">Partnership</h2>
<p>If the structure of your partnership changes and a partner leaves or one is added, call us at <span class="nowrap"><strong>1-800-959-5525</strong></span>.</p>
<p>A change of partners will have a different impact on your business depending on your partnership agreement. The legal name of the business may need to change depending on how it was registered:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the business uses a provincially registered operating name, it may not need to change</li>
<li>If it was registered using the legal names of each partner, it may need to change</li>
</ul>
<p>In some cases, if the partners change, the business is considered a new legal entity and requires a new business number as well as new <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> program accounts.</p>

 <h3>Non-resident of Canada</h3>
<p>If you are a partnership who is a <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> of Canada, go to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information/non-resident-gst-hst-enquiries.html">Non-resident GST/HST Enquiries</a>.</p>

  
        <h2 id="corporation">Corporation</h2>
<p>To avoid any delays or issues, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> must have up-to-date corporation information on the owners/directors or if their structure changes. </p>

</ul>
 <h3>Legal implications</h3>
<p>It is important to make sure that the incorporating authority's registry and the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> have the correct directors' names on file. In certain circumstances, there may be legal implications for outgoing and incoming directors. We recommend that you get familiar with the corporate laws in the jurisdiction in which you are incorporated. </p>

   <h2 id="entities">Legal entity other than sole proprietorships, partnerships and corporations</h2>
