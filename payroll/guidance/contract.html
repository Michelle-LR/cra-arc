<p>There must be a valid contract in place to determine if the engagement is considered as employment or self-employment. To use the guidance on the worker classification, there must be, or will be, a valid contract in place.</p>
<details> <summary>Examples of questions the CRA may ask you to determine the validity and the terms of the contract</summary>
<h3 id="h_1_1">Validity of a contract</h3>
<ul>
<li>Are the parties to the contract of legal age (as per the respective provincial Employment Standards site)? If the worker is not of legal age, have the parents or legal guardians provided written consent for the minor child to work? </li>
<li>Did the parties have any mental disabilities that would prevent them from understanding the nature of the contract? </li>
<li>What was the offer, which is, what was the worker hired to do? </li>
<li>What did the worker agree to do? </li>
<li>Where was the work to be performed? </li>
<li>What was the agreed consideration for providing the service? </li>
<li>Was there an agreed method of payments? </li>
<li>Was there an agreed duration for the service to be performed? </li>
<li>Is the party a citizen or permanent resident of Canada? If no, does the party have a work permit to legally work in Canada?</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="h_1_2">Intent of the parties</h3>
<ul>
<li>When you first entered into the agreement, what was your understanding of the work relationship (employee or self-employed)? </li>
<li>Why do you feel that you were an employee or a self-employed person? </li>
<li>Was there a written contract? Was the contract signed by both parties? </li>
<li>Were there any amendments to the original agreement? If yes, was it verbal or written? You may need to provide details of the verbal amendments or you may need to provide a copy of the amendments. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h_1_3">Documents to review</h3>
<ul>
<li>Payer's payroll records - Is the worker listed on payer's payroll? </li>
<li>Were there CPP, EI or income tax deductions withheld from the worker's pay? </li>
<li>Was a pay stub given to the worker when he/she was remunerated? </li>
<li>Was the worker issued a T4 information slip? </li>
<li>In addition to remuneration, did the worker receive vacation pay, paid vacation leave, statutory holiday or sick leave? </li>
<li>Did the worker participate or belong to the payer's private pension plan? </li>
<li>Is the worker entitled or belonged to the payer's benefit plans, for example: fitness membership, medical or dental plans? </li>
<li>Is the worker listed as part of the staff in the payer's staff phone directory or payer's website? </li>
<li>Is the worker named as part of the staff in any of the payer's business brochure? </li>
<li>Did the payer provide business cards to the worker? If yes, did the business cards bear the payer's business name? What was the worker's title or position listed on the business cards? </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h_1">What is considered a valid contract</h2>

<p>Contracts can be formed either orally or in writing. An oral contract is as valid and enforceable as a written contract.</p>

</div></div>
<h2 id="h_2">Who decides when a contract is null and void</h2>
<p>When addressing the issue of statutory illegality, the courts can decide that a contract is null and void from the beginning (void ab initio) if the formation of the contract was prohibited by statute and if, in the court's assessment, it would not be contrary to public policy to declare the contract void ab initio.</p>

<h2 id="h_3">Cessation of a contract</h2>
<p>Examples of when a contract is terminated:</p>

<ul>
<li>The death of one of the parties</li>
<li>The expiry of the time stipulated for the duration of the contract by the parties or by law (in the absence of any by the parties) </li>
<li>Confusion arising as a result of both parties to the contract becoming one in the same (for example, an individual buys a business (sole proprietorship) that they have an existing contract with and becomes both parties to the same contract) </li>
<li>Misrepresentation </li>
<li>Fraud </li>
<li>Duress </li>
<li>The effect of a resolutory clause in the contract (this would be a clause in the contract that serves to release the parties to the contract from an obligation in the event of a stipulated occurrence or series of events)</li>
<li>The disrespect of the main clauses of the contract, or significant breach of the conditions outlined in the contract </li>
<li>A judgment from a competent court</li>
<li>When the performance required by the contract becomes impossible for one or more of the parties to the contract to honour (reasons such as a change in law making it illegal for one of the parties to meet their obligations, or the physical incapacity (injury or mental illness) of one or more of the parties can cause a contract to become impossible to honour)</li>
<li>When both the obligations and the consideration set out in the contract have been satisfied (once a contract is completed, it is at its cessation) </li>
</ul>
