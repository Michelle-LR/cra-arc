<p>Content has been developed to provide guidance only. The guidance does not replace the law and does not replace a formal request for a ruling. <strong>No changes were made to the existing federal legislative requirement. </strong></p>
</div>

<p>This guidance gives you the CRA's general view of a worker's employment status based on common situations. It can also be used to help you understand if changes to the terms of the contract or working arrangements changes a worker's employment status.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="h_1">Determine if a valid contract exists</h2>

<p>There <strong>must be a valid contract</strong> in place to see if the engagement is considered as employment or self-employment. </p>
<p>Learn more: <a href="/cra-arc/payroll/guidance/contract.html">Determine if a contract is valid</a>.</p>

<li>Why do you feel that you were an employee or a self-employed person? </li>
<li>Was there a written contract? Was the contract signed by both parties? </li>
<li>Were there any amendments to the original agreement? If yes, was it verbal or written? You may need to provide details of the verbal amendments or you may need to provide a copy of the amendments. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h_1_3">Documents to review</h3>
<ul>
<li>Payer's payroll records - Is the worker listed on payer's payroll? </li>
