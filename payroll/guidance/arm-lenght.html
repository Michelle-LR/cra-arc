<details class="acc-group"> <summary class="wb-toggle tgl-tab" data-toggle='{"parent": "#acc-who1a", "group": ".acc-group"}'>Common-law</summary>
<p>Two individuals are related to each other if they are in a common-law partnership with each other. The CRA considers that two individuals are in a common-law partnership if:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">They live together in a conjugal relationship and have done so for a continuous period of at least 12 months</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">They live together in a conjugal relationship and have a child together (this includes through adoption), in which case the 12-month period does not apply</li>
</ul>
<p>They are also related to anyone connected by blood relationship (parents and siblings) to their common-law partner. </p>

<p>If there is a breakdown in the relationship, they are considered to continue to live in a common-law partnership until they have lived separate and apart for 90 consecutive days.</p>
<p>Depending on the situation, the person may be related by adoption to any children of their common-law partner, depending on the circumstances. <a href="#adopt">Adoption</a>. </p>

<details><summary>Example</summary>
<p>Jack and Jill had a child together. They began living together in a conjugal relationship 1 month before their child was born. They are common-law partners as of the day their child is born. If they did not have a child together, they would not be common-law partners until they lived together for 12 months.</p>
