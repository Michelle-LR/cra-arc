<p>You must determine if the trust is related to a person. Generally, the rules for determining if a trust is related to another person are the same as for other persons.</p>

<p>What is the type of trust?</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>bare trust </strong>exists where a trustee is merely vested with the legal title to property and has no other duty to perform or responsibilities to carry out as trustee, in relation to the property vested in the trust.</li>
<li>A <strong>testamentary trust </strong>is a trust or estate that is generally created on and as result of the death of the person.&nbsp;</li>
<li>A <strong>personal trust</strong> (for 2016 and subsequent tax years) means:
<ul>
<li>a trust that arose on and as a consequence of the individual&rsquo;s death if it meets the conditions to be&nbsp;a graduated rate estate</li>
<li>a trust in which no beneficial interest was acquired for consideration payable to the trust or to any person or partnership that has made a contribution to the trust</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An <strong>inter-vivos trust</strong> is any trust, other than a testamentary trust.&nbsp;<select>

<details class="acc-group"> <summary class="wb-toggle tgl-tab" data-toggle='{"parent": "#acc-who1d", "group": ".acc-group"}'>Bare trust</summary>
<p>A trust that is considered to be a bare trust acts as agent for the beneficiary.&nbsp;The CRA considers the beneficiary is the person dealing&nbsp;with other parties&nbsp;with respect to the trust property.</p>
<p>&nbsp;To find out whether the beneficiary is related to those parties, go to <strong>A corporation and a person (or group of persons)</strong>.</p>
<p>The sole duty of a bare trustee is to convey legal title to the trust property on demand,&nbsp;on the instructions of the&nbsp;beneficial owner&nbsp;(beneficiary). The bare trustee does not have any independent power, discretion or responsibility pertaining to the trust property. The beneficiary&nbsp;retains the right to control and direct the trustee in all matters relating to the trust property.</p>
<details><summary>Example</summary>
<p>123 Property Trust holds property for A Corp (the beneficiary). The beneficiary&nbsp;directs the trustee in all matters relating to the property.&nbsp;The&nbsp;trustee does not have any independent power, discretion or responsibility pertaining to the&nbsp;property.</p>
<p>It is likely that 123 Property Trust is a bare trust. The benficiary&nbsp;instructs 123 Property Trust to transfer the property to B Corp. A Corp and B Corp are related to each other.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because A Corp and B Corp are related to each other, the transfer of the property&nbsp;is a non-arms-length transaction.</p>
<p>Had the role of the trustee been different, for example, if the trustee had discretionary power or responsibility to manage the property, the trust&nbsp;would not be a bare trust. In that case, if 123 Property Trust was not related to B Corp, the transaction would be at arm's length.</p></details>

<p>A personal trust is a specified personal trust if it is <strong>not </strong>described in paragraphs 108(1)(a) to (e.1)</p>

<p>&nbsp;To find out if a trust is related to a corporation, see <strong>A corporation and a person (or group of persons)</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>the same person is a beneficiary of each trust</li>
