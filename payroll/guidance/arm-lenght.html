<details class="acc-group"> <summary class="wb-toggle tgl-tab" data-toggle='{"parent": "#acc-who1a", "group": ".acc-group"}'>Marriage</summary>
<p>Two individuals are related to each other if they are legally married to each other. They are also related to anyone connected by blood relationship (parents and siblings) to their spouse. They may be related by adoption to any children of their spouse, depending on the circumstances. For more information, see <strong>Situation 4 - Adoption</strong></p>
<p>If the marriage is dissolved because of divorce or death of a spouse, the individual ceases to be connected by marriage.</p>
<details><summary>Example</summary>
<p>Jack and Jill were married on June 15, 2016. Later, their marriage broke down and they were legally divorced on October 1, 2019. For the period from the date of marriage until the date of their legal divorce, Jack and Jill were related to each other as well as their respective parents-in-law and brothers/sisters-in-law.</p>

<details class="acc-group"> <summary class="wb-toggle tgl-tab" data-toggle='{"parent": "#acc-who1a", "group": ".acc-group"}'>Common-law</summary>
<p>Two individuals are related to each other if they are in a common-law partnership with each other. CRA considers that two individuals are in a common-law partnership if:</p>
<ul>
<li>they live together in a conjugal relationship and have done so for a continuous period of at least 12 months</li>
<li>they live together in a conjugal relationship and have a child together (this includes through adoption), in which case the 12-month period does not apply</li>
</ul>
<p>They are also related to anyone connected by blood relationship (parents and siblings) to their common-law partner. They may also be related by adoption to any children of their common-law partner, depending on the circumstances. For more information, see <strong>Situation 4 - Adoption</strong>. </p>
<p>If there is a breakdown in the relationship, they are considered to continue to live in a common-law partnership until they have lived separate and apart for 90 consecutive days.</p>
<details><summary>Example</summary>
<p>Jack and Jill had a child together. They began living together in a conjugal relationship 1 month before their child was born. They are common-law partners as of the day their child is born. If they did not have a child together, they would not be common-law partners until they lived together for 12 months.</p>

<details class="acc-group"> <summary class="wb-toggle tgl-tab" data-toggle='{"parent": "#acc-who1a", "group": ".acc-group"}'>Adoption</summary>
<p>Two individuals are related to each other through adoption if one individual is the adopted child of the other. In addition to their parents, the child is also related to their siblings, grandparents and great-grandparents.</p>
<p>Adoption includes legal adoption and de facto adoption. The following factors are considered when determining whether a de facto adoption exists:</p>
<ul>
<li>actual control and custody</li>
<li>an exercise of parental care and responsibility on a continuing basis</li>
<li>dependency</li>
<li>proximity to each other</li>
</ul>
<details><summary>Example</summary>
