<p>A trust that is considered to be a bare trust acts as agent for the beneficiary. The CRA considers the beneficiary is the person dealing with other parties with respect to the trust property.</p>
<p> To find out whether the beneficiary is related to those parties, go to <strong>A corporation and a person (or group of persons)</strong>.</p>
<p>The sole duty of a bare trustee is to convey legal title to the trust property on demand, on the instructions of the beneficial owner (beneficiary). The bare trustee does not have any independent power, discretion or responsibility pertaining to the trust property. The beneficiary retains the right to control and direct the trustee in all matters relating to the trust property.</p>
<details><summary>Example</summary>
<p>123 Property Trust holds property for A Corp (the beneficiary). The beneficiary directs the trustee in all matters relating to the property. The trustee does not have any independent power, discretion or responsibility pertaining to the property.</p>
<p>It is likely that 123 Property Trust is a bare trust. The benficiary instructs 123 Property Trust to transfer the property to B Corp. A Corp and B Corp are related to each other. </p>
<p>Because A Corp and B Corp are related to each other, the transfer of the property is a non-arms-length transaction.</p>
<p>Had the role of the trustee been different, for example, if the trustee had discretionary power or responsibility to manage the property, the trust would not be a bare trust. In that case, if 123 Property Trust was not related to B Corp, the transaction would be at arm's length.</p></details>
