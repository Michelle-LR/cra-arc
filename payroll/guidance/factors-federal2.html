<h3>Result: You are not sure if the worker is a PSB or not</h3>
<p>A corporation is carrying on a PSB if the incorporated employee that provides services to the person on behalf of the corporation <strong>could reasonably be considered an employee of that person if the corporation did not exist</strong>.</p>
<p>An <strong>employee-employer relationship </strong>between the incorporated employee and the person that received the services must be shown. Both are therefore bound by a contract of employment instead of a contract of enterprise. </p>
<p>The <strong>factors </strong>used to determine whether an <strong>employee-employer relationship </strong>exists are the same factors used to determine a worker's status as an employee or self-employed worker. </p>

<p>To determine the employee-employer relationship, continue to <a href="factors.html">Guidance on the worker classification</a>.</p>
<p>If you determine that the <strong>worker is considered an employee, the worker is also considered a PSB.</strong></p>
<details><summary>Read full-text - Conditions to be considered a PSB</summary>
<div id="ajax-psb">
<p>The worker is considered a PSB if <strong>all</strong> of the following conditions apply:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The incorporated employee who is performing the services, or any person related to the incorporated employee, is a <strong>specified shareholder </strong>of the corporation (a specified shareholder is an individual who <strong>directly or indirectly owns at least 10% of the issued shares </strong>of any class of a capital stock of the corporation or a related corporation) </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The incorporated employee, if it were not for the existence of the corporation, would reasonably be considered an officer or employee of the entity receiving the services </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The corporation does not employ <strong>more </strong>than five full-time employees throughout the year </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The corporation's income is from services performed by the worker, as the incorporated employee, on behalf of the corporation </li>
</ul>
<details><summary>Example of a PSB</summary>
<p>John Smith is offered a 20 month IT contract with ABC Corp. However, ABC Corp. requires John to offer his services through a corporation. John sets up a corporation for which he will be the sole employee and shareholder of that corporation. ABC Corp. then pays the newly set up corporation as John performs services for them. It will be John's responsibility to pay himself through his own corporation as he is an incorporated employee.</p>
<p>By comparison, Cliff Jones operates his own sole proprietorship and provides IT consulting and support to numerous clients. He controls his hours of work providing that the client's needs are met, provides the equipment and supplies, hires employees to help him do the work. If Cliff incorporates, and continues to have multiple clients and possibly employees, he is considered to be operating a business as a corporation.</p>
<p>This is in contrast to John's situation, where John only provides IT services to ABC Corp. His services would normally be provided by an employee of ABC Corp. Therefore, John's corporation is a PSB.</p></details>

<li><h3> Ownership of the tools and equipment</h3>
<p id="3">Consider if the worker owns and provides tools and equipment to accomplish the work. Contractual control of, and responsibility for, an asset in a rental or lease situation is also considered under this factor.</p>	
<details><summary>What is considered a significant investment</summary>
<p>What is relevant is the significant investment in the tools and equipment along with the cost of replacement, repair, and insurance. A worker who has made a significant investment is likely to retain a right over the use of these assets, diminishing the payer's control over how the work is carried out. In addition, such a significant investment may place the worker at a risk of a financial loss.</p>
<p>Tools and equipment can vary widely in terms of value and can include everything from wrenches and hammers, to specialized clothing, appliances, stethoscopes, musical instruments, computers, and vehicles such as trucks and tractors.</p>
<p>Self-employed individuals often supply the tools and equipment required for a contract. As a result, the ownership of tools and equipment by a worker is more commonly associated with a business relationship.</p>
<p>However, employees sometimes also have to provide their own tools. The courts have acknowledged that because a worker is required to provide tools of the trade, this does not in itself mean that the worker is a self-employed individual. For example, many skilled tradespeople such as auto mechanics have to supply their own tools, even if they are full-time employees.</p>

<li><h3> Opportunity for profit (incorporated employee (such as PSBs) or a self-employed through their own corp) </h3>
<p id="7">Consider whether the worker can realize a profit or incur a loss, as this indicates that a worker controls the business aspects of services rendered and that a business relationship likely exists. To have a chance of a profit and a risk of a loss, a worker has to have potential proceeds and expenses, and one could exceed the other.</p>
<details><summary>Consider this factor from the worker's perspective</summary>
<p>This factor has to be considered from the worker's perspective, not the payer's. It is for the most part an assessment of the degree to which the worker can control their proceeds and expenses.</p>
<p>Employees normally do not have the chance of a profit and risk of a loss even though their remuneration can vary depending on the terms of their employment contracts. For example, employees working on a commission or piece-rate basis, or employees with a productivity bonus clause in their contract can increase their earnings based on their productivity. This increase in income is not normally viewed as a profit, as it is not the excess of proceeds over expenses.</p>
<p>Employees may have expenses directly related to their employment, such as automobile expenses, and board and lodging costs. Normally, expenses would not place employees at risk of incurring a loss because it is unlikely that the expenses would be greater than their remuneration.</p>
<p>Self-employed individuals normally have the chance of profit or risk of loss, because they have the ability to pursue and accept contracts as they see fit. They can negotiate the price (or unilaterally set their prices) for their services and have the right to offer those services to more than one payer. Self-employed individuals will normally incur expenses to carry out the terms and conditions of their contracts, and to manage those expenses to maximize net earnings. Self-employed individuals can increase their proceeds and/or decrease their expenses in an effort to increase profit.</p>
<p>Employees generally do not share in profits or suffer losses incurred by the payer's business.</p>
<p>The method of payment may help to decide if the worker has the opportunity to make a profit or incur a loss. In an employer-employee relationship, the worker is normally guaranteed a return for the work done and is usually paid on an hourly, daily, weekly, or similar basis.</p>
<p>Similarly, some self-employed individuals are paid on an hourly basis. However, when a worker is paid a flat rate for the work done, it generally indicates a business relationship, especially if the worker incurs expenses in doing the work.</p>

<li><h3>Relationship of subordination</h3>
<p id="5" class="brdr-bttm">Under the civil law the relationship of subordination constitutes the main element for determining a worker’s status. From the Civil Code of Quebec it is concluded that the existence of a relationship of subordination with respect to the performance of work is the main element of a contract of employment. The subordination is a legal subordination and, however minimal, suggests the existence of a contract of employment.</p>

<h2 id="h-2">Analyze the facts</h2> 
<p>You need to analyze the facts by organizing and assessing the information you gathered. This process will move the worker into one side of the continuum, and confirm if there is an employment relationship, or if the worker is in business on his own account.</p>
<p>You must analyze the answer to each question from both the payer <strong>and </strong>the worker to help you decide if the evidence moves the worker to the employee or self-employed side of the continuum.</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><span class="fas fa-people-arrows text-primary fa-2x"> </span> Worker is an employee</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><span class="fas fa-user text-primary fa-2x"> </span> Worker is self-employed</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="h_0_1">Weighing the facts</h3>
<p>This is the most important part of analyzing the information. When reviewing the factors, there may be some facts that support an employee-employer relationship and other facts indicate self-employement.</p>
<p>To help you resolve this issue, you must determine the true essence of the working relationship of the parties. You must review the indicators in the factors of control, ownership of tools and equipment, opportunity for profit and financial risk, and responsibility for investment and management. As you respond to each question you should be able to decide what weight to assign each category based on a thorough review of all the responses. For example, control may favour an employee relationship, but ownership of tools may be assigned <strong>more weight </strong>due to how the total relationship is structured. This may be an indicator because of the increased weight given to this factor, the worker is moved into the independent contractor side of the continuum.</p>
<h3 id="h_0_2">Case-by-case basis</h3>
<p>Whether a worker is an employee or self-employed needs to be analyzed on a case-by-case basis. Each case is unique and requires a thorough review of the facts. It is also important to remember that when attempting to move a worker to one side of the continuum or the other, you must examine the <strong>total working relationship</strong>. There is no one factor that is determinative, and there is a non-exhaustive list of factors to consider.</p>


<h2 id="h-3">Consider special situations</h2> 

<p>A deemed employer is one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>a third party that generally controls, directly supervises, or pays the remuneration to an insured person in its own name and not on behalf of the actual employer. </li>
<li>a person who has rights or privileges on premises or property under a licence, permit, or agreement and who agrees to allow another employer's workers to work on these premises or property. </li>
</ul>
<p>Analyzing the relationship: </p>

<ul>
<li>who supervises the worker? </li>
<li>where do the workers perform their tasks? </li>
<li>does the party paying the salary act in its own name? </li>
<li>what is the procedure for issuing pay? </li>
