	<p>The consumer must present you with an original certificate showing that the goods are being acquired by an Indian Band. The delivery must be verifiable.</p>
	<p><strong>Records:</strong> You must keep supporting records on file in case CRA requests official proof of any deduction or credit you claim. On your invoice or sales receipt, you will need the consumer's 9 or 10 digit Indian registry number or the band name and family number (commonly referred to as the band number/treaty number), which is found on the card. For those who have a temporary confirmation or registration document, you need to record the registration number and expiration date on the invoice or other sales document.</p>
