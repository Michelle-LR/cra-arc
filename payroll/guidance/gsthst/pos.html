   <p>Use this interactive content to determine the POS for GST/HST. You may also need to determine whether it is a single supply or multiple supplies being made. If multiple supplies are being made, it can affect which place of supply rule to use. Different tax rates may apply.</p>
<details><summary> How to determine if it is a single supply or multiple supplies </summary>
<p>For instance, where it is determined that a single supply consisting of different types of elements is made, it would generally be the relevant general place of supply rule that would apply to that supply, rather than the specific place of supply rule that would apply to each of the elements of the supply if they were instead determined to be supplied separately.</p>
<p>For GST/HST purposes, the determination of whether a transaction consisting of several elements is to be regarded as a single supply or multiple supplies is based on a determination of fact. The following principles are used to determine whether a transaction consisting of several elements is to be regarded as a single supply or multiple supplies:</p>

<ul>
<li>Every supply should be regarded as distinct and independent. </li>
<li>A supply that is a single supply from an economic point of view should not be artificially split. </li>
<li>There is a single supply where one or more elements constitute the supply and any remaining elements serve only to enhance the supply. </li>
</ul>
<p>There are various issues to consider in conducting a single/multiple supply analysis.</p>
