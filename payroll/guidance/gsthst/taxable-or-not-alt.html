He has cultivated the land to control the weeds. He sells the land to his nephew who will use the land solely for his personal use and enjoyment. This sale is exempt. If John buys the land so that he can continue using it in farming activities, the sale would be taxable.</p>Example 2: George owns farmland and sells it to a corporation. The sales of the farmland is taxable.</p>Example 3:Mary uses her farmland in a commercial business but not farming. She sells it to her neighbour, Terry. The sale is taxable because they are not related to each other and Mary used the land for reasons other than farming.</p>Example 2: A schoolteacher owns a farm where she undertakes limited farming activities without a reasonable expectation of profit. She decides to sell the farm to her brother. Since the teacher did not use the land at any time in a commercial activity that is the business of farming, the sale of the farmland is not exempt under the provisions of section 10 of Part I of Schedule V. It should be noted, however, that the sale would be exempt under section 9 of Part I of Schedule V.<p>Learn more: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/19-5/land-associated-real-property-2.html#P109_18797">Land and Associated Real Property - Canada.ca</a></p></p></details><p class="bg-success mrgn-tp-md"><strong>Tax status if all requirements are met: </strong>  Exempt</p><div class="row"><p class="mrgn-bttm-0 text-muted pull-right mrgn-rght-md  small">  ETA: Schedule V, Part I, s.10 and Section 10, 11 and 12 of Part I of Schedule V</p></div></li>

This may occur, for example, where land has been severed from a residential complex and supplied separately from the land upon which the complex is situated. Consequently, a sale of such land is not exempt under section 2, 3, 4 or 5 of Part I of Schedule V, which exempt, under certain conditions, a sale of a residential complex or an interest in one. The sale of the land would not usually qualify for exemption under section 5.2 of Part I of Schedule V, which exempts the sale of land that forms part of a residential complex. Section 9 of Part I of Schedule V may apply to exempt the sale of land by an individual provided that the sale meets the other requirements of the section.</p><h4>Example</h4><p>Mr. Acres owns a three-hectare parcel of land. In 2012, he subdivided that parcel into one two-hectare lot and one one-hectare lot then sold the one-hectare lot. That sale is exempt.<p>In January 2020, Mr. Acres subdivided the remaining two-hectare lot into two lots of one hectare each and sold those lots to people who are not related to him. Until that sale, the vacant land had been used primarily for Mr. Acres' personal use and enjoyment.<p> Since these one-hectare lots were produced by the further severance of the two-hectare lot which had itself been severed from the original three-hectare parcel, his sale of these one-hectare lots to people who are not related to him is GST/HST taxable.<p></p></details><p class="bg-warning mrgn-tp-md"><strong>Tax status: </strong>  Taxable at 5%, 13% or 15% depending on the location</p><div class="row"><p class="mrgn-bttm-0 text-muted pull-right mrgn-rght-md  small">  ETA: 136(2) and Schedule V, Part I, paragraph 9(2)(c)</p></div></li>
