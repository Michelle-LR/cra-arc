The sale of the property is also taxable at 5%, 13% or 15% when sold by an individual or personal trust where:</p><ul><li>Immediately before the time ownership or possession of the property is transferred, it is capital property that was used primarily (more than 50%) in a business carried on by the individual or personal trust with a reasonable expectation of profit. </li><li>The sale is made in the course of a business of the individual or personal trust </li><li>The sale is made in the course of an adventure or concern in the nature of trade and the individual or personal trust has elected to have the sale treated as a taxable supply. </li></ul><h4>Exempt situations </h4><p>In certain situations the sale of real property made by an individual or a personal trust may be GST/HST exempt. For more information our GST/HST Rulings provides free technical rulings and interpretations. You may contact then at 1-800-959-8287.</p></p><h4>Example</h4><p>A building owner leases the building to a person and under the terms of the lease the person is entitled to assign the leasehold interest to a third party for consideration. Such an assignment is considered to be a sale of real property since a lessee that transfers its leasehold interest to a third party is transferring the ownership of the real property (in other words, the ownership of the leasehold interest) and therefore is making a sale of real property. The assignor in such a case is subject to the same provisions in respect of GST/HST obligations and entitlements that govern any other sale of real property.</p></details><p class="bg-success mrgn-tp-md"><strong>Tax status if all requirements are met: </strong>  </p><div class="row"><p class="mrgn-bttm-0 text-muted pull-right mrgn-rght-md  small">  </p></div></li>
