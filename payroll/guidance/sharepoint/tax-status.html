Since the teacher did not use the land at any time in a commercial activity that is the business of farming, the sale of the farmland is not exempt under the provisions of section 10 of Part I of Schedule V. It should be noted, however, that the sale would be exempt under section 9 of Part I of Schedule V.<p>Learn more: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/19-5/land-associated-real-property-2.html#P109_18797">Land and Associated Real Property - Canada.ca</a></p><p class="bg-success mrgn-tp-md"><strong>Tax status if all requirements are met: </strong>  Exempt</p><div class="row"><p class="mrgn-bttm-0 text-muted pull-right mrgn-rght-md  small">  ETA: Schedule V, Part I, sections 10, 11 and 12 of Part I of Schedule V</p></div></details></li>

In 2012, he subdivided that parcel into one two-hectare lot and one one-hectare lot. He sold the one-hectare lot at that time. Since subparagraph 9(2)(c)(i) of Part I of Schedule V provides that a supply of a part of a parcel of land by an individual is exempt if the parcel is subdivided or severed into only two parts and if the originating parcel had not been subdivided or severed from another parcel, the sale of that one-hectare lot was exempt.

In January 2020, Mr. Acres subdivided the remaining two-hectare lot into two lots of one hectare each and sold those lots to people who are not related to him. Until that sale, the vacant land had been used primarily for Mr. Acres' personal use and enjoyment.

Since these one-hectare lots were produced by the further severance of the two-hectare lot which had itself been severed from the original three-hectare parcel, his sale of these one-hectare lots to people who are not related to him is GST/HST taxable at 13%.

Even though there is a gap in time in this example between the first subdivision and the second, the rules found in subparagraph 9(2)(c)(i) made the January 2020 sale of the remaining lots taxable.<p class=""bg-success mrgn-tp-md""><strong>Tax status if all requirements are met: </strong>  Taxable at 5%, 13% or 15% depending on the location</p><div class=""row""><p class=""mrgn-bttm-0 text-muted pull-right mrgn-rght-md  small"">  ETA: Schedule V, Part I, paragraph 9(2)(c) </p></div></details></li>"
