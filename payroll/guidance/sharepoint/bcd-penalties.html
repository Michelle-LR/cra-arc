	</header>
	<div class="modal-body">
		<p>Generally, a remote store refers to a store that during the previous 12-month period, made more than 50% of its sales to First Nations individuals, First Nations bands and band-empowered entities and is in <strong>one</strong> of the following situations:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The store is located more than 350 kilometres from the nearest community with a population of 5,000 or more</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Surface transportation is not available year-round on paved or gravelled roads linking the store to the nearest community</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The store is within 10 kilometres of a reserve</li>
</ul>
<p>A store in a remote location but that doesn't meet the sales condition because it does not have a sales history may still qualify as a remote store based on a reasonable expectation of such sales. An example of a store without a sales history is a newly opened store.</p>

<h4>Vendor that qualifies as a remote store</h4>
<p>Vendors who choose to operate as a remote store must keep records of their sales made to First Nations individuals, First Nations bands and band-empowered entities.</p>

<p>If you qualify and decide to operate as a remote store, each year, you have to let your tax services office know how you are operating.</p>
