		<p>Generally, a remote store refers to a store that during the previous 12-month period, made more than 50% of its sales to First Nations individuals, First Nations bands and band-empowered entities and is in <strong>one</strong> of the following situations:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">

<h4>Vendor that qualifies as a remote store</h4>
<p>Vendors who choose to operate as a remote store must keep records of their sales made to First Nations individuals, First Nations bands and band-empowered entities.</p>

<p>If you qualify and decide to operate as a remote store, each year, you have to let your tax services office know how you are operating.</p>
