<h3>Result: You are not sure if the worker is a PSB or not</h3>
<p>A corporation is carrying on a PSB if the incorporated employee that provides services to the person on behalf of the corporation <strong>could reasonably be considered an employee of that person if the corporation did not exist</strong>.</p>
<p>An <strong>employee-employer relationship </strong>between the incorporated employee and the person that received the services must be shown. Both are therefore bound by a contract of employment instead of a contract of enterprise. </p>
<p>The <strong>factors </strong>used to determine whether an <strong>employee-employer relationship </strong>exists are the same factors used to determine a worker's status as an employee or self-employed worker. </p>
<h3><span class="fas fa-people-arrows text-primary fa-2x"> </span> How to determine the employee-employer relationship</h3>
<p>To determine the employee-employer relationship, continue to <a href="factors.html">Guidance on the worker classification</a>.</p>
<p>If you determine that the <strong>worker is considered an employee, the worker is also considered a PSB.</strong></p>
<details><summary>Read full-text - Conditions to be considered a PSB</summary>
<div id="ajax-psb">
<p>The worker is considered a PSB if <strong>all</strong> of the following conditions apply:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The incorporated employee who is performing the services, or any person related to the incorporated employee, is a <strong>specified shareholder </strong>of the corporation (a specified shareholder is an individual who <strong>directly or indirectly owns at least 10% of the issued shares </strong>of any class of a capital stock of the corporation or a related corporation) </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The incorporated employee, if it were not for the existence of the corporation, would reasonably be considered an officer or employee of the entity receiving the services </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The corporation does not employ <strong>more </strong>than five full-time employees throughout the year </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The corporation's income is from services performed by the worker, as the incorporated employee, on behalf of the corporation </li>
</ul>
<details><summary>Example of a PSB</summary>
<p>John Smith is offered a 20 month IT contract with ABC Corp. However, ABC Corp. requires John to offer his services through a corporation. John sets up a corporation for which he will be the sole employee and shareholder of that corporation. ABC Corp. then pays the newly set up corporation as John performs services for them. It will be John's responsibility to pay himself through his own corporation as he is an incorporated employee.</p>
<p>By comparison, Cliff Jones operates his own sole proprietorship and provides IT consulting and support to numerous clients. He controls his hours of work providing that the client's needs are met, provides the equipment and supplies, hires employees to help him do the work. If Cliff incorporates, and continues to have multiple clients and possibly employees, he is considered to be operating a business as a corporation.</p>
<p>This is in contrast to John's situation, where John only provides IT services to ABC Corp. His services would normally be provided by an employee of ABC Corp. Therefore, John's corporation is a PSB.</p></details>
