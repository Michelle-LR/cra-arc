<h2 id="h_2">Types of employment status for tax purposes</h2>
<p>The main types of employment status are:</p>

 <ul class="fa-ul">
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li fa-lg text-success"> </span> Employee </li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li fa-lg text-success"> </span> Self-employed and contractor </li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li fa-lg text-success"> </span> Incorporated employee (operating a personal service business)</li>
</ul>

<p>An individual may be an employee in employment law but have a different status under the tax law. As an employer or a payer, you must work out each worker’s status in both employment law and tax law.</p>

<details><summary>Tax law</summary>
<p>The CRA determine the employment relationship on the basis of common law and the CPP, EI legislation and the ITA (and the Quebec Civil Code for Quebec employees). </p>

<h4>Canada Labour Code</h4>
<p>The Employment and Social Development Canada are responsible to enforce the Canada Labour Code. The federal labour standards set out the employment conditions for hours of work, payment of wages, leaves, vacation, holidays, and more. These standards apply to employees working in federally regulated businesses. </p>

<h4>Province or Territory Labour Code</h4>
<p>If the employee is <strong>not </strong>working in a federally regulated industry, the province or territory is responsible to enforce the Labour Code. </p>

<h2 id="h_3">Determine if a contract is valid</h2>

<div id="ajax-contract">

<p>The CRA requires that a valid contract is in place to determine if the worker is considered an employee or is self-employed. However, you may still want to determine the worker classification even if there is no valid contract in place.</p>

<p>Contracts can be formed either orally or in writing. An oral contract is as valid and enforceable as a written contract.</p>

<p>The CRA may request a copy of the contract or testimony by the parties to review the parties's actions. This review is to identify the intentions of both parties in the context of the employment.</p>

<p>Generally, all of the following elements apply when a contract is valid:</p>

 <div class="table-responsive">
      <table class="table table-striped small table-condensed">
        <caption class="wb-inv">
       Examples of a valid contract
        </caption>


<thead class="small">

<tr>
<th scope="col">Description</th>
<th scope="col">Element</th>
</tr>

</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
	<td><p>There must be an offer and an acceptance of the terms and conditions of the agreement from the parties.  </p>
<p>In a valid contract, one party makes an offer and the other party accepts the offer. </p></td>
	<td>Offer and acceptance </td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<td><p>There must be compensation or a reward for a party to carry out its obligations under the contract. </p>
<p>After an offer is accepted, something of value is exchanged between the two parties.</p> </td>
	<td>Consideration </td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<td><p>The parties involved must be legally capable of entering into the contract. Both parties must have the ability or capacity to understand the terms and nature of the contract. For example, as per the respective provincial Employment Standards, one of the following applies:</p>
 <ul class="fa-ul">
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li fa-lg text-success"> </span> The worker has the legal age to work </li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li fa-lg text-success"> </span> The parents or legal guardians provides written consent for the minor child to work</li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li fa-lg text-success"> </span> Both parties does have a mental disability that prevents them from understanding the nature of the contract</li>
</ul>

 </td>
	<td>Capacity </td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><p>The agreement must be mutual. </p>
<p>Each party must freely consent to the terms of the contract. There can be no undue influence or pressure to force a party to make or accept an offer.</p></td>
	<td>Consent/intent to be legally bound </td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<td><p>The object of the contract must be legitimate. </p>
<p> A contract must be lawful in inent and cannot be made to execute illegal business activities.</p></td>
	<td>Obligation/lawful purpose </td>
</tr>

<details><summary>Who decides when a contract is nul and void</summary>
<div id="ajax-contract-null">
<p>When addressing the issue of statutory illegality, the courts can decide that a contract is null and void from the beginning (void ab initio) if the formation of the contract was prohibited by statute and if, in the court's assessment, it would not be contrary to public policy to declare the contract void ab initio.</p>
</div>
</details>

<details><summary>Examples of termination of a contract</summary>
<div id="ajax-contract-stop">
<p>The following are examples of when a contract is terminated:</p>

<ul>
<li>The death of one of the parties</li>
<li>The expiry of the time stipulated for the duration of the contract by the parties or by law (in the absence of any by the parties) </li>
<li>Confusion arising as a result of both parties to the contract becoming one in the same (for example, an individual buys a business (sole proprietorship) that they have an existing contract with and becomes both parties to the same contract) </li>
<li>Misrepresentation </li>
<li>Fraud </li>
<li>Duress </li>
<li>The effect of a resolutory clause in the contract (this would be a clause in the contract that serves to release the parties to the contract from an obligation in the event of a stipulated occurrence or series of events)</li>
<li>The disrespect of the main clauses of the contract, or significant breach of the conditions outlined in the contract </li>
<li>A judgment from a competent court</li>
<li>When the performance required by the contract becomes impossible for one or more of the parties to the contract to honour (reasons such as a change in law making it illegal for one of the parties to meet their obligations, or the physical incapacity (injury or mental illness) of one or more of the parties can cause a contract to become impossible to honour)</li>
<li>When both the obligations and the consideration set out in the contract have been satisfied (once a contract is completed, it is at its cessation) </li>
</ul>
</div>
</details>
</div>

<h2 id="h_4">What if you made an error in the employment status</h2>
<p>Individuals and employers may have to pay unpaid tax and penalties, or lose entitlement to benefits, if their employment status is wrong.</p>

<h2 id="h_5">What if you are not sure if the worker is an employee or self-employed </h2>
<p>You need to consider multiple factors to determine if the worker is an employee or is self-employed. You can use the CRA guidance to help you gather the facts based on your sitution. </p>

 <div class="row">
	 <div class="col-xs-3 col-sm-2">

	<p>If you are still not sure if the worker is an employee or self-employed after following the CRA guidance, you can ask for a CPP/EI ruling.  </p>
