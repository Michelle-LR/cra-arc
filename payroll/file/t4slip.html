            <p>The following examples show how to fill in boxes 14 and 26 of your employee's T4 slip when you provide a benefit or earnings to an employee that is only taxable in Quebec. </p>
            <details><summary>Example 1&ndash; Quebec taxable benefit, unpaid leave</summary>
            <p>Marion works for her employer in Quebec and is on an unpaid leave of absence. Her employer pays $750 in premiums to an employer-paid private health benefit plan on her behalf. Since the benefit is not taxable outside of Quebec, it is not income. When preparing Marion's Quebec T4 slip, her employer will leave box 14 blank. Since the premiums are QPP pensionable, her employer will report $750 in box 26, the QPP contributions withheld on the benefit in box 17, and fill in any other boxes on her T4 slip as applicable.</p>
         </details>    
		    <details><summary>Example 2 &ndash; Quebec taxable benefit, other earnings</summary>
            <p>During 2021, Julien received wages of $25,000 plus an $875 benefit that is only taxable in Quebec. When preparing Julien's Quebec T4 slip, his employer will report $25,000 in box 14, $25,875 in box 26, and fill in any other boxes on his T4 slip as applicable.</p>

            <p>Stephane works for his employer in Quebec and did not receive any cash earnings. However, his employer gave him a non-cash housing benefit valued at $1,100.

            <p>For the 2020 tax year <strong> only </strong>, additional reporting requirements will apply to all employers, and will help the CRA validate payments under the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS), the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), and the Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB).</p> 
            <p>In addition to reporting employment income in Box 14 or Code 71, use new "Other information" codes when reporting employment income and retroactive payments in the following periods:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Code 57 – Employment Income – March 15 to May 9, 2020</li>
            <li>Code 58 – Employment Income – May 10 to July 4, 2020</li>
            <li>Code 59 – Employment Income – July 5 to August 29, 2020</li>
            <li>Code 60 – Employment Income – August 30 to September 26, 2020</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Eligibility criteria for the CERB, CEWS, and CESB is based on employment income for a defined period. The new requirement means employers should report income and any retroactive payments made during these periods.</p>
            <p>Employers who have already filed their T4 slips and summary for 2020 will not need to refile.</p> 
            <p>If you are reporting employment income for the period of April 25 to May 8, payable on May 14, use code 58.</p>
