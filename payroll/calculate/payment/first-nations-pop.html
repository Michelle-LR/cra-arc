<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
<p>Section 87 of the Indian Act exempts from taxation the personal property of an Indian situated on a reserve. The courts have determined that, for the purposes of section 87 of the Indian Act, employment income is personal property. In the case of employment income earned by an Indian, therefore, what must be determined is whether the employment income is situated on a reserve. The courts have directed that connecting factors must be considered when making this determination. Revenue Canada, after receiving representations from interested Indian groups and individuals, has identified a number of connecting factors that can be used to determine whether employment income is situated on a reserve.</p> <p>The location of the employment duties is a major connecting factor. However, the Department also recognizes that employees of bands, tribal councils, or organizations that operate on behalf of bands or tribal councils may perform most of their activities off reserve. For the employees, the connection to a reserve is that the employer is resident on a reserve and the Indian is employed in a non-commercial activity for the social, cultural, educational, or economic development of Indians who for the most part live on reserves.</p> <p>With a view to assisting the Indian community, the Department has developed the following guidelines, incorporating the various relevant connecting factors, that describe the employment situations covered by section 87 of the Indian Act. The treatment of other income related to employment is also discussed.</p> <p><strong>These guidelines are an administrative tool to assist indians in determining whether their employment income is exempt or not.</strong> </p> <p>Most employment situations that are subject to the exemption from taxation are covered in this brochure. However, it should be noted that, when applying all the connecting factors, there may be unusual or exceptional circumstances where all of the following apply:</p> 
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The income may not be taxable even though it does not fall within one of the guidelines; or</li> 
 <li class="cnjnctn-col">The income may be taxable even though it appears to fall within one of these guidelines.</li> 
</ul>

        <h2 id="1">Guideline 1</h2>
<div id="guide1">
<p>When at least 90% of the duties of an employment are performed on a reserve, all of the income of an indian from that employment will usually be exempt from income tax.</p> 
</div>

    <details><summary>Examples where exempt</summary>
      
<div id="example1a">    
   
   <p>Employee A works as a mechanic for an automobile repair shop, performing their duties in a garage located on a reserve. The wages the employee receives are exempt because the duties are performed on a reserve.</p>  

<p>Employee B lives off reserve and works as a driver for a heating-oil supplier, performing almost all of their duties making deliveries to houses on a reserve. The wages the employee receives are exempt because more than 90% of the duties are performed on a reserve.</p> 

 <p>Employee C works in an office on a reserve. The employee's duties include a daily drive into a nearby town where the employee does the banking for the business and picks up the mail and supplies for the business. The wages the employee receives are exempt, although the employee incidentally leaves the reserve in the course of carrying out the duties.</p>  
    
</div>
    </details>
        <details><summary>Examples where <strong>not</strong> exempt</summary>
<div id="example1b">  
 <p>Employee D works for a logging company that is not resident on a reserve, cutting trees under license on provincial Crown land. The wages the employee receives are taxable because the land does not form part of a reserve. </p>  
<p>Employee D lives on a reserve, but this factor alone is not sufficient to connect the income to a location on a reserve.</p>  
    
</div>
    </details>
        <h2 id="pro">Proration rule</h2>
<div id="guide1pro">
 <p>When less than 90% of the duties of an employment are performed on a reserve and the employment income is not exempted by another guideline, the exemption is to be prorated. The exemption will apply to the portion of the income related to the duties performed on the reserve.</p> 
    </div>

 
<details><summary>Examples where exempt</summary>

          
<div id="example1apro">   
    
          <p>Employee E lives off reserve and works for a government department, mostly at a location off reserve. The employee spends one-half day per week on a regular basis working in a clinic on a reserve. Since 1/10 of the employee's work is performed on a reserve, 10% of the employee's income from this employment is exempt.</p>  
<p>Employee F lives off reserve and works for a club at a location off reserve. Each summer, the employee works for the club at a 1 month camp operated on a reserve. The employee's income earned at the summer camp is exempt.</p>  
 
</div>
</details>

         <details><summary>Example where <strong>not</strong> exempt</summary>

<div id="example1bpro">   
 <p>Employee G lives off reserve and works for a stationery store located off reserve. On rare occasions, the employee delivers some of the store's goods to customers on reserve. None of the employee's income is exempt. The trips to the reserve are merely occasional and are not a meaningful connecting factor.</p>  
   
</div>
</details>
    
        <h2 id="2">Guideline 2</h2> 
<div id="guide2">
<p>When all of the following apply:</p> 
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The employer is resident on a reserve; and</li> 
 <li class="cnjnctn-col">The indian lives on a reserve</li> 
</ul> <p>All of the income of an indian from an employment will usually be exempt from income tax.</p> 
  </div>



   
         <details><summary>Examples where exempt</summary>
  
    
<div id="example2a"> 
    
          <p>Employee H works for a logging company that is resident on a reserve. The employee lives on a reserve, but performs the duties at lumber camps located off the reserve. The employee's employment income is exempt from income tax because the place where the employee lives and the residence of the employee's employer are factors connecting the income to a reserve.</p> 
 <p>Employee I is a construction worker employed by a construction company that is resident on a reserve, to work on building sites that are not located on a reserve. The employee lives on a reserve, except for short periods each year when the employee lives near the construction sites. When away from the reserve, the employee retains their residence on the reserve where the employee's family lives. Employee I is exempt from income tax on their employment income because the place where the employee lives and the residence of the employee's employer are factors connecting his employment income to a reserve.</p>  
    
</div>
    </details>
      <details><summary>Examples where <strong>not</strong> exempt</summary>
 
<div id="example2b"> 
<p>Employee J lives on a reserve and works as an accountant at the head office of a bank located off reserve in a nearby city. The bank maintains a branch on employee J's reserve and arranges for the employee to be paid at that branch. The employee's employment income is taxable because the only substantive factor linking the employee's employment income to a reserve is their residence which, without other substantial connecting factors, does not result in exemption. Payment on the reserve is viewed as a connecting factor of relatively little weight.</p> 
 <p>Employee K is a construction worker employed by a corporation situated on a reserve. The corporation is an employment agency that makes employees available to work for clients that are not situated on a reserve, on building sites not located on a reserve. Employee K lives on a reserve. The employment agency had an office on the reserve, but carried out very few of its business activities on the reserve. The guidelines would not apply in this case, and one must therefore do an analysis of the connecting factors. Employee K's employment income is taxable because the residence of the employer in this case has little weight as a connecting factor. The only other substantive factor connecting employee K's employment income to a reserve is their residence, which is not sufficient to bring the employment income within the exemption.</p>

Mr. N is exempt from income tax on his employment income because the duties he performs for the tribal council are connected to the reserves served by the council, and the employer is resident on a reserve.</p> 
 <p>Ms. O is a librarian working for a technical training institute operated by five Indian bands for Indians who live on reserve. The administrative office of the institute is on a reserve. Ms. O lives off reserve and works at an off-reserve location central to several reserves. Ms. O is exempt from income tax on her employment income because the duties she performs for the Indian organization that employs her are connected to the reserves served by the Indian organization, and the employer is resident on a reserve.</p> 
 <p>Mr. P works for an Indian organization providing child and family related services to members of a large number of bands with reserves scattered over a large area within a province. Some of these services are provided in the provincial capital, where Mr. P works, and the organization's administrative office is at an off-reserve location central to the bands served. However, the organization's directors, consisting of the band chiefs, meet at each reserve in rotation. Mr. P is exempt from income tax on his employment income because the duties he performs for the Indian organization that employs him are connected to the reserves served by the Indian organization, and the employer is resident on a reserve.</p>  
<p>Ms. Q works for a company that is resident on a reserve and owned by a tribal council. The company exists to provide adequate low-cost housing on reserves and the company's property is for the most part on reserves. Ms. Q performs her duties at an off-reserve location central to several reserves. Ms. Q is exempt from income tax on her employment income because the duties she performs for the Indian organization that employs her are connected to the reserves served by the Indian organization, and the employer is resident on a reserve.</p> 
 <p>Mr. R works for an Indian organization that manages funds provided by the government to assist in planning for future education needs on reserves. His employer is resident on a reserve, but he works at a location off reserve.

 <p>Ms. T works for an Indian organization dedicated to organizing social programs for off-reserve Indians. The organization is located off reserve. Ms. T is taxable on her employment income because there are no factors connecting that income to a location on a reserve.</p>

<p>The receipt of unemployment insurance benefits, retiring allowances, canada pension plan payments, quebec pension plan payments, registered pension plan benefits or wage loss replacement plan benefits will usually be exempt from income tax when received as a result of employment income that was exempt from tax.

Mr. U is currently unemployed and receives Unemployment Insurance benefits. Since the income from employment that entitled him to these benefits was not subject to income tax, the Unemployment Insurance benefits will not be subject to income tax.</p>  

<p>Mrs. V worked for a public health office located in a city off reserve. Throughout her career, one-fifth of her annual employment income was exempt from income tax because she spent one day a week performing her duties at a clinic on a nearby reserve. Upon retiring, Mrs. V received a retiring allowance from her employer and started receiving Canada Pension Plan payments. One-fifth of her retiring allowance and one-fifth of her Canada Pension Plan payments will not be subject to income tax.</p>
