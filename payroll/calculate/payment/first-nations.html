<p>You must report all income and deductions on a T4 or T4A slip for First Nations wokers regardless of whether the income is taxable or exempt.</p>

<p><span class="fa fa-balance-scale fa-lg text-muted"></span> Many Indigenous people in Canada prefer not to describe themselves as "Indians" and view this term as rooted in colonialism and racism. Under the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-5/">Indian Act</a>, the precise legal meaning of the term "Indian" refers to First Nations persons who are entitled to registration.</p>

<h3 id="h_1">Determine if the worker is registered with Indigenous Services Canada (ISC) </h3>
<p>You must determine if the worker is registered with ISC and their effective date for registration. </p>

<p>The CRA requires proof of registration with ISC. The effective date for registration means the date that the First Nations worker is eligible for the tax exemption under section 87 of the Indian Act on the income they earn on a reserve.</p>

<p>ISC is responsible for the Indian Register and is the only one authorized to issue a "certificate of Indian status" to an individual.</p>

<details><summary>Situation: Your employee lives on a reserve and you are a resident on a reserve </summary>
<h4>Exempt income situation</h4>
<p>The status Indian individual's (status confirmed in step 1) income is exempt from income tax under section 87 of the Indian Act if <strong>all </strong>of the following apply:</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Employee lives on a reserve (this means it is their principal place of residence and is the centre of their daily routine) </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Employer is a resident on a reserve (this means the reserve is the place where the central management and control over the employer organization is actually located) </li>
</ul>

<p><span class="fas fa-arrow-down text-success fa-lg"> </span> To find out what payroll deductions you have to withhold on <strong> exempt income</strong> in this situation, continue to: <a href="#ex">Step 4a: Withhold payroll deductions and remit GST/HST</a>.</p>

<details><summary>Examples where exempt</summary>
<h4>Example 1</h4>
<p>Mrs. H works for a logging company that is resident on a reserve. Mrs. H lives on a reserve, but performs the duties at lumber camps located off the reserve. The employment income is exempt from income tax because the place where the employee lives and the residence of their employer are factors connecting the income to a reserve.</p>
<h4>Example 2</h4>
<p>Mr. I is a construction worker employed by a construction company that is resident on a reserve, to work on building sites that are not located on a reserve. Mr. I lives on a reserve, except for short periods each year when he lives near the construction sites. When away from the reserve, he retains his residence on the reserve where his family lives. Mr. I is exempt from income tax on his employment income because the place where he lives and the residence of his employer are factors connecting his employment income to a reserve.</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Examples where not exempt</summary>
<h4>Example 1</h4>
<p>Ms. J lives on a reserve and works as an accountant at the head office of a bank located off a reserve in a nearby city. The bank maintains a branch on Ms. J's reserve and arranges for her to be paid at that branch. Ms. J's employment income is taxable because the only substantive factor linking her employment income to a reserve is her residence which, without other substantial connecting factors, does not result in exemption. Payment on the reserve is viewed as a connecting factor of relatively little weight.</p>
<h4>Example 2</h4>
<p>Mr. K is a construction worker employed by a corporation situated on a reserve. The corporation is an employment agency that makes employees available to work for clients that are not situated on a reserve, on building sites not located on a reserve. Mr. K lives on a reserve. The employment agency had an office on the reserve, but carried out very few of its business activities on the reserve. The guidelines would not apply in this case, and one must therefore do an analysis of the connecting factors. Mr. K's employment income is taxable because the residence of the employer in this case has little weight as a connecting factor. The only other substantive factor connecting Mr. K's employment income to a reserve is his residence, which is not sufficient to bring the employment income within the exemption.</p>
<h4>Example 3</h4>
<p>Ms. B lives on a reserve and works as director general on that reserve for their corporation (of which they are a shareholder). Their administrative offices are located on reserve but the work is carried out mostly off the reserve. Ms. B receives a salary from their corporation. This salary is exempt. Ms. B pays themselves a bonus on top of their salary. The bonus is based on the company's performance. The connecting factor of the bonus is not sufficient to bring that income within the exemption.</p>

<p>Where an employee is a shareholder who controls the business (non-arm's length with the corporation), the source of the business income may be relevant in determining whether the tax exemption under section 87 of the Indian Act applies to the income received in the shareholder's capacity as an employee. Where the source of the business income in this situation is off the reserve, the employment income (salary and bonuses) will not be considered to be connected to the reserve and will not be exempt from tax. </p>

</details>

<details><summary>Situation: Other situations where your employee is required to perform duties on a reserve</summary>
<p>Depending on your situation, the employment income of status Indians may be exempt or partly exempt from tax. It is the income that is exempt from tax and not the person. </p>
<p>The rules for CPP and EI are different. EI premiums are always required. Income that is exempt from income tax is not pensionable employment although you or the employee may elect into the CPP.</p>
<p><span class="fas fa-arrow-down text-success fa-lg"> </span> To determine if the income is exempt or partly from tax in this situation, continue to: <a href="#h_3">Step 3: Determine the percentage of duties related to employment on a reserve</a>.</p>

</details>
</li>
<li>	  
<h3 id="h_3">Determine the percentage of duties related to employment on a reserve</h3>
<p>To determine the portion of employment duties performed on a reserve, two factors are generally taken into account:</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Whether an actual "duty of employment" was performed (the employee was required to perform the particular task and was compensated by the employer for performing that particular task)</li>

<dt>Employer is resident on a reserve</dt><dd>
<p>"Employer is resident on a reserve" means that the reserve is the place where the central management and control over the employer organization is actually located.</p>
<p>The central management and control of an organization is usually considered to be exercised by the group that performs the function of a board of directors of the organization. However, the real management and control of an organization may be exercised by some other person or group. Generally, management and control is exercised at the principal place of business but it is recognized that this function may be legitimately exercised in a place other than the principal administrative office of the organization. It is a question of fact where the central management and control is exercised.</p>
