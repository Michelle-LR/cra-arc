<p>Generally, if you pay a fee to a person to provide a service outside of an employment relationship or <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/canada-pension-plan-cpp-employment-insurance-ei-rulings/cpp-ei-explained/canada-pension-plan-employment-insurance-explained-14.html">tenure of office</a>, you need to fill out a T4A slip. This includes payments of fees for services between businesses (including sole proprietors and corporations). Depending on the situation, you may need to fill out a T4A-NR, T5018 or T1204 instead.</p>

<details><summary>When are executor, administrator and power of attorney's fees considered fees for services</summary>
<h3>Executor fees</h3>
<p>An executor is an individual or trust institution named in a will and confirmed by a court to settle a deceased's estate. Generally in situations where an individual dies without a will, or the will does not name an executor, a court will appoint an administrator to handle the deceased's estate. Often, executors and administrators are paid a fee for their services.</p>
<h3>Power of attorney fees</h3>
<p>When someone has been delegated as a power of attorney, they may be paid a fee for their services.  The deductions for the fees paid are treated the same as for executor fees. </p>
<h3>Deductions and reporting</h3>
<p>Generally, fees paid to an executor, administrator, or a person who has a delegated power of attorney are either considered <strong>business income</strong> or income from <strong>employment or <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/canada-pension-plan-cpp-employment-insurance-ei-rulings/cpp-ei-explained/canada-pension-plan-employment-insurance-explained-14.html">tenure of office</a></strong>.</p>

<details><summary>Example</summary>
<h4>Situation 1 </h4>
<p>You contract with a designer to construct a display in your store. The design is customized for your promotional needs. The contracted worker constructs the display to fit your space using materials they bring to the job. The worker is not your employee.</p>

<p>In this situation, you are acquiring a service and you would need to report the payment on a T4A slip.</p>
<h4>Situation 2</h4>
<p>Another business purchases a similar display. The display is pre-fabricated and uses a generic design meant to suit the needs of any business. The vendor sends their worker to assemble and install the display. </p>

<p>In this situation, this business has purchased goods and they would not need to report the payment.</p>

<li class="cnjnctn-col">The payment was not made to one of your employees </li>

<p>If you or an individual  working for you is not sure of the worker's employment status (employee or self-employed), either one of you can request a CPP/EI ruling to determine the status and whether the employment or the earnings are   pensionable, insurable or both.</p>
