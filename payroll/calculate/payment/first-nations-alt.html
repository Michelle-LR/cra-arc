<p>Content has been updated to remove the word Indian where it is not a direct reference to the Indian Act, including improving clarity, completeness and plain language. <strong>No changes were made to the existing legislative requirement or to the CRA administrative policy. </strong></p>

    <h3 class="h4 mrgn-tp-0">Meaning of the terms “First Nations employee”, “First Nations recipient” and “First Nations worker” </h3>
<p>On this webpage, the terms “First Nations employee”, “First Nations recipient” and “First Nations worker” are used to describe an individual who is registered or entitled to be registered under the Indian Act.</p>
    <p>We recognize that many First Nations people in Canada prefer <strong>not</strong> to describe themselves as Indians. However, we sometimes use the term “Indian” because it has a legal meaning in the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-5/">Indian Act</a>. </p>
    </div>
 </div>

<p>You have a legal obligation to report all income and deductions on a T4 or T4A slip for First Nations workers regardless of whether the income is taxable or exempt. </p>

<details><summary>What is the <strong>purpose of reporting exempt income</strong> on a T4 or T4A slip </summary>
<p>Since net exempt income is not reported on a T1 return, these amounts are used to calculate using Form T90, Income Exempt from Tax under the Indian Act. The information on Form T90 is used to determine the eligibility of the worker for the Canada Workers' Benefit and other related provincial or territorial benefits. </p>

<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
<p>Section 87 of the Indian Act exempts from taxation the personal property of a <a href="#fnterm" aria-controls="fnterm" class="overlay-lnk" role="button">First Nations employee <span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a> situated on a reserve. The courts have determined that, for the purposes of section 87 of the Indian Act, employment income is personal property. In the case of employment income earned by a First Nations employee, therefore, what must be determined is whether the employment income is situated on a reserve. The courts have directed that connecting factors must be considered when making this determination. The Canada Revenue Agency, after receiving representations from interested First Nations groups and individuals, has identified a number of connecting factors that can be used to determine whether employment income is situated on a reserve.</p> 

<p>The location of the employment duties is a major connecting factor. However, the Department also recognizes that employees of bands, tribal councils, or organizations that operate on behalf of bands or tribal councils may perform most of their activities off reserve. For the employees, the connection to a reserve is that the employer is resident on a reserve and the First Nations employee is employed in a non-commercial activity for the social, cultural, educational, or economic development of First Nations individuals who for the most part live on reserves.</p> 

<p>With a view to assisting the First Nations community, the Department has developed the following guidelines, incorporating the various relevant connecting factors, that describe the employment situations covered by section 87 of the Indian Act. The treatment of other income related to employment is also discussed.</p> 

<p><strong>These guidelines are an administrative tool to assist First Nations employees in determining whether their employment income is exempt or not.</strong> </p> 

<p>Most employment situations that are subject to the exemption from taxation are covered in this brochure. However, it should be noted that, when applying all the connecting factors, there may be unusual or exceptional circumstances where all of the following apply:</p> 
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The income may not be taxable even though it does not fall within one of the guidelines; or</li> 
 <li class="cnjnctn-col">The income may be taxable even though it appears to fall within one of these guidelines.</li>

<p>When at least 90% of the duties of an employment are performed on a reserve, all of the income of a First Nations employee from that employment will usually be exempt from income tax.</p> 
</div>

    <details><summary>Examples where exempt</summary>
      
<div id="example1a">    
  <h4>Example - Employee A</h4> 
   <p>Employee A works as a mechanic for an automobile repair shop, performing their duties in a garage located on a reserve. The wages the employee receives are exempt because the duties are performed on a reserve.</p>  
<h4>Example - Employee B</h4> 
<p>Employee B lives off reserve and works as a driver for a heating-oil supplier, performing almost all of their duties making deliveries to houses on a reserve. The wages the employee receives are exempt because more than 90% of the duties are performed on a reserve.</p> 
<h4>Example - Employee C</h4> 
 <p>Employee C works in an office on a reserve. The employee's duties include a daily drive into a nearby town off reserve where the employee does the banking for the business and picks up the mail and supplies for the business. The wages the employee receives are exempt, although the employee incidentally leaves the reserve in the course of carrying out the duties.</p>  
    
</div>
    </details>
        <details><summary>Example where <strong>not</strong> exempt</summary>
<div id="example1b">  
 <h4>Example - Employee D</h4> 
 <p>Employee D works for a logging company that is not resident on a reserve, cutting trees under license on provincial Crown land. The wages the employee receives are taxable because the land does not form part of a reserve. </p>  
<p>Employee D lives on a reserve, but this factor alone is not sufficient to connect their income to a location on a reserve.</p>  
    
</div>
    </details>
        <h3 id="pro">Proration rule</h3>
<div id="guide1pro">
 <p>When less than 90% of the duties of an employment are performed on a reserve and the employment income is not exempted by another guideline, the exemption is to be prorated. The exemption will apply to the portion of the income related to the duties performed on the reserve.</p> 
    </div>

 
<details><summary>Examples where exempt</summary>

          
<div id="example1apro">   
<h4>Example - Employee E</h4> 
          <p>Employee E lives off reserve and works for a government department, mostly at a location off reserve. The employee spends one-half day per week on a regular basis working in a clinic on a reserve. Since 1/10 of the employee's work is performed on a reserve, 10% of the employee's income from this employment is exempt.</p>  
<h4>Example - Employee F</h4>  
<p>Employee F lives off reserve and works for a club at a location off reserve. Each summer for 1 month, the employee works for the club at a camp operated on a reserve. The employee's income earned at the summer camp is exempt.</p>

<h4>Example - Employee G</h4>  
<p>Employee G lives off reserve and works for a stationery store located off reserve. On rare occasions, the employee delivers some of the store's goods to customers on reserve. None of the employee's income is exempt. The trips to the reserve are merely occasional and are not a meaningful connecting factor.</p>

   <h4>Example - Employee H</h4> 
          <p>Employee H works for a logging company that is resident on a reserve. The employee lives on a reserve, but performs their duties at lumber camps located off the reserve. The employee's employment income is exempt from income tax because the place where the employee lives and the residence of the employee's employer are factors connecting the income to a reserve.</p> 
<h4>Example - Employee I</h4> 
<p>Employee I is a construction worker, employed by a construction company that is resident on a reserve, to work on building sites that are not located on a reserve. The employee lives on a reserve, except for short periods each year when the employee lives near the construction sites. When away from the reserve, the employee retains their residence on the reserve where the employee's family lives. Employee I is exempt from income tax on their employment income because the place where the employee lives and the residence of the employee's employer are factors connecting his employment income to a reserve.</p>

    </details>
      <details><summary>Examples where <strong>not</strong> exempt</summary>
 
<div id="example2b"> 
<h4>Example - Employee J</h4> 
<p>Employee J lives on a reserve and works as an accountant at the head office of a bank located off reserve in a nearby city. The bank maintains a branch on employee J's reserve and arranges for the employee to be paid at that branch. The employee's employment income is taxable because the only substantive factor linking the employee's employment income to a reserve is their residence which, without other substantial connecting factors, does not result in exemption. Payment on the reserve is viewed as a connecting factor of relatively little weight.</p> 
 <h4>Example - Employee K</h4> 
 <p>Employee K is a construction worker employed by a corporation situated on a reserve. The corporation is an employment agency that makes employees available to work for clients that are not situated on a reserve, on building sites not located on a reserve. Employee K lives on a reserve. The employment agency had an office on the reserve, but carried out very few of its business activities on the reserve. The guidelines would not apply in this case, and one must therefore do an analysis of the connecting factors. Employee K's employment income is taxable because the residence of the employer in this case has little weight as a connecting factor. The only other substantive factor connecting employee K's employment income to a reserve is their residence, which is not sufficient to bring the employment income within the exemption.</p>

Employee N lives off reserve and the tribal council is resident on one of the reserves. Employee N is exempt from income tax on their employment income because the duties the employee performs for the tribal council are connected to the reserves served by the council, and the employer is resident on a reserve.</p> 
 <h4>Example - Employee O</h4> 
 <p>Employee O is a librarian working for a technical training institute operated by 5 First Nations bands for First Nations individuals who live on reserve. The administrative office of the institute is on a reserve. Employee O lives off reserve and works at an off-reserve location central to several reserves. Employee O is exempt from income tax on their employment income because the duties the employee performs for the First Nations organization that employs the employee are connected to the reserves served by the First Nations organization, and the employer is resident on a reserve.</p> 
 <h4>Example - Employee P</h4>  
<p>Employee P works for an First Nations organization providing child and family related services to members of a large number of bands with reserves scattered over a large area within a province. Some of these services are provided in the provincial capital, where employee P works, and the organization's administrative office is at an off-reserve location central to the bands served. However, the organization's directors, consisting of the band chiefs, meet at each reserve in rotation. Employee P is exempt from income tax on their employment income because the duties the employee performs for the First Nations organization that employs the employee are connected to the reserves served by the First Nations organization, and the employer is resident on a reserve.</p>  
 <h4>Example - Employee Q</h4> 
<p>Employee Q works for a company that is resident on a reserve and owned by a tribal council. The company exists to provide adequate low-cost housing on reserves and the company's property is for the most part on reserves. Employee Q performs their duties at an off-reserve location central to several reserves. Employee Q is exempt from income tax on their employment income because the duties the employee performs for the First Nations organization that employs the employee are connected to the reserves served by the First Nations organization, and the employer is resident on a reserve.</p> 
 <h4>Example - Employee R</h4>  
<p>Employee R works for an First Nations organization that manages funds provided by the government to assist in planning for future education needs on reserves. The employee's employer is resident on a reserve, but the employee works at a location off reserve. Employee R is exempt from income tax on their employment income because the duties the employee performs for the First Nations organization that employs the employee are connected to the reserves served by the First Nations organization, and the employer is resident on a reserve.</p>

<details><summary>Examples where <strong>not</strong> exempt</summary>
<div id="example4b"> 
 <h4>Example - Employee S</h4> 
 <p>Employee S works for a commercial building supplies company that is owned by a tribal council and is resident on a reserve. The employee performs their duties off reserve and lives off reserve. Employee S is taxable on their employment income because, although there is one factor, the residence of the employer, connecting the income to a reserve, this factor by itself is not sufficient to confer the exemption when the employer and the employee are active in the commercial mainstream of society.</p> 
 <h4>Example - Employee T</h4> 
 <p>Employee T works for an First Nations organization dedicated to organizing social programs for off-reserve First Nations individuals. The organization is located off reserve. Employee T is taxable on their employment income because there are no factors connecting that income to a location on a reserve.</p>

        <h2 id="emp">Employment-related income</h2> 

<div id="emp-related">
<p>The receipt of unemployment insurance benefits, retiring allowances, Canada Pension Plan payments, Quebec Pension Plan payments, registered pension plan benefits or wage loss replacement plan benefits will usually be exempt from income tax when received as a result of employment income that was exempt from tax. </p>
<p>If a portion of the employment income was exempt, then a similar portion of these amounts will be exempt.</p>

<div id="example-emp-related"> 
    <h4>Example - Employee U</h4>  
          <p>Employee U has always lived on a reserve and, until recently, the employee worked as a labourer for an employer located on the reserve. Employee U is currently unemployed and receives Employment Insurance benefits. Since the income from employment that entitled the employee to these benefits was not subject to income tax, the Employment Insurance benefits will not be subject to income tax.</p>  
 <h4>Example - Employee V</h4> 
<p>Employee V worked for a public health office located in a city off reserve. Throughout the employee's career, 1/5 of the employee's annual employment income was exempt from income tax because the employee spent 1 day a week performing their duties at a clinic on a nearby reserve. Upon retiring, employee V received a retiring allowance from their employer and started receiving Canada Pension Plan payments. 1/5 of the employee's retiring allowance and 1/5 of the employee's Canada Pension Plan payments will not be subject to income tax.</p>

<p>An employer requires their First Nations employee to perform duties related to their employment both on and off reserve. The employee had a total of 220 working days in the year, 44 of which were on reserve. These days spent working on the reserve did not include either vacation or sick leave. The employee had taken 40 days off for vacation, sick leave, statutory holidays, family leave and personal days, which are not included in the total of 220 working days, as these were days not spent working.</p>
