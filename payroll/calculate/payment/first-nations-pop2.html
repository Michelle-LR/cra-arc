     <p>Throughout the following text, for purposes of the tax exemption under section 87 of the Indian Act, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) uses the term “Indian” because it has a legal meaning in the Indian Act.</p>
<p>We want you to be aware of tax benefits and requirements that apply to you as an individual who is an <a href="#hdng17">Indian</a> as defined in the Indian Act. On these pages, you will find general information on income tax, the goods and services tax/harmonized sales tax (GST/HST) and excise tax. There may be exceptions to the information we have provided here, and we have not dealt with all situations.</p>

    
<h2>How to obtain an application for coverage of employment of an Indian in Canada under the Canada Pension Plan whose income is exempt under the Income Tax Act</h2>

        <h3>Election by the employer</h3>
 <p>The employment of an Indian hired pursuant to a contract of service (employer/employee relationship), whose earnings are not included in computing income for purposes of the Income Tax Act is excepted from pensionable employment. However, conditions have been established to enable the worker to participate in the <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr>. Accordingly, the employment of an Indian may be included in pensionable employment provided all of the following conditions are met:</p>  

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The Indian is resident in Canada for the purposes of the Income Tax Act</li> 
 <li class="cnjnctn-col">The employer elects to pay <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> contributions for all Indian workers</li> 
</ul> 

<p>The employer must complete, in prescribed form, a <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/cpt124.html">CPT124 -&nbsp;Application for Coverage of Employment of an Indian in Canada under the Canada Pension Plan Whose Income is Exempt under the Income Tax Act</a>.</p>  
    

    
        <h3>Election by the employee</h3>
 <p>Where the employer does not elect to cover Indian employees under the <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr>, an Indian's employment may still be included in pensionable employment provided that all of the following conditions are met:</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and">
 <li class="cnjnctn-col">The employer refuses to apply for coverage for his Indian employees</li> 
 <li class="cnjnctn-col">The Indian is resident in Canada for purposes of the Income Tax Act</li> 
 <li class="cnjnctn-col">The Indian's employment is not pensionable by virtue of any other provision of the Act or Regulations</li> 
 <li class="cnjnctn-col">The Indian makes an election to have his employment included as pensionable employment</li> 
 <li class="cnjnctn-col">The Indian pays within one year after April 30 of the following year the required contribution (both the employer and employee shares)</li> 
</ul>  
    

        <h3>Self-Employment on a reserve</h3>
 <p>A self-employed Indian's income from self-employment on a reserve is not included in contributory earnings for <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> purposes. However, a provision of the Canada Pension Plan Regulations has the effect of negating this exclusion under the Canada Pension Plan. Consequently, an Indian who is self-employed on a reserve can participate in the <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr>.</p>  <p>An Indian who is self-employed on a reserve and wishes to participate in the <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> must meet all of the following conditions:</p> 

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and">
 
 <li class="cnjnctn-col">the income for <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> purposes is all income earned on the reserve plus any other income earned elsewhere, if applicable</li> 
<li class="cnjnctn-col">a federal income tax return (T1) is filed, although this has no bearing on the Indian's taxability for income tax purposes</li> 
<li class="cnjnctn-col">the required contribution (both the employer and employee shares) is included with the federal tax return for the year of the pensionable employment</li> 
</ul>  
    
 <h3>What to do if the Indian is living on a reserve in the province of Quebec </h3>
    
<p>Indians living on reserves in the province of Quebec should contact <a href="https://www.revenuquebec.ca/en/">Revenu Québec</a> for information concerning participation in the Québec Pension Plan.</p>
