  <p>Special rules apply to First Nations workers. You will find information to help you determine if a First Nations worker can participate or not in the Canada Pension Plan (CPP). </p>   
<h2>How to apply for the CPP if a First Nations worker's income is exempt under the Income Tax Act</h2>

<details><summary>Election by the <strong>employer</strong></summary>  
      
 <p>The employment of a <a href="#fnterm" aria-controls="fnterm" class="overlay-lnk" role="button">First Nations employee <span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a> hired pursuant to a contract of service (employer/employee relationship), whose earnings are not included in computing income for purposes of the Income Tax Act is excepted from pensionable employment. However, conditions have been established to enable the worker to participate in the <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr>. Accordingly, the employment of a First Nations employee may be included in pensionable employment provided all of the following conditions are met:</p>  

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The First Nations employee is resident in Canada for the purposes of the Income Tax Act</li> 
 <li class="cnjnctn-col">The employer elects to pay <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> contributions for all First Nations workers</li> 
</ul> 

<p>The employer must complete, in prescribed form, a <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/cpt124.html">CPT124 -&nbsp;Application for Coverage of Employment of an Indian in Canada under the Canada Pension Plan Whose Income is Exempt under the Income Tax Act</a>.</p>  
    
  </details> 

  <details><summary>Election by the <strong>employee</strong></summary>  
      
 <p>Where the employer does not elect to cover all <a href="#fnterm" aria-controls="fnterm" class="overlay-lnk" role="button">First Nations employees <span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a> under the <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr>, a First Nations employee's employment may still be included in pensionable employment provided that all of the following conditions are met:</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and">
 <li class="cnjnctn-col">The employer refuses to apply for coverage for their First Nations employees</li> 
 <li class="cnjnctn-col">The First Nations employee is resident in Canada for purposes of the Income Tax Act</li> 
 <li class="cnjnctn-col">The First Nations employee's employment is not pensionable by virtue of any other provision of the Act or Regulations</li> 
 <li class="cnjnctn-col">The First Nations employee makes an election to have their employment included as pensionable employment</li> 
 <li class="cnjnctn-col">The First Nations employee pays within one year after April 30 of the following year the required contribution (both the employer and employee shares)</li> 
</ul>  
   </details> 

<details><summary><strong>Self-employment</strong> on a reserve</summary>
       
 <p>A <a href="#fnterm" aria-controls="fnterm" class="overlay-lnk" role="button">First Nations worker's <span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a> income from self-employment on a reserve is not included in contributory earnings for <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> purposes. However, a provision of the Canada Pension Plan Regulations has the effect of negating this exclusion under the Canada Pension Plan. Consequently, a First Nations worker who is self-employed on a reserve can participate in the <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr>.</p>  

<p>A First Nations worker who is self-employed on a reserve and wishes to participate in the <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> must meet all of the following conditions:</p> 

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and">
 
 <li class="cnjnctn-col">The income for <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> purposes is all income earned on the reserve plus any other income earned elsewhere, if applicable</li> 
<li class="cnjnctn-col">A federal income tax return (T1) is filed, although this has no bearing on the First Nations worker's taxability for income tax purposes</li> 
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The required contribution (both the employer and employee shares) is included with the federal tax return for the year of the pensionable employment</li> 
</ul>  
</details>
 <h2>What to do if the First Nations worker is living on a reserve in the province of Quebec </h2>
    
<p>A <a href="#fnterm" aria-controls="fnterm" class="overlay-lnk" role="button">First Nations worker <span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a> living on a reserve in the province of Quebec should contact <a href="https://www.revenuquebec.ca/en/">Revenu Québec</a> for information concerning participation in the Quebec Pension Plan.</p>
