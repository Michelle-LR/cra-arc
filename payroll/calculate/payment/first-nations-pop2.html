        <h3>Election by the Employer</h3>
 <p>The employment of an Indian hired pursuant to a contract of service (employer/employee relationship), whose earnings are not included in computing income for purposes of the <em>Income Tax Act</em> is excepted from pensionable employment. However, conditions have been established to enable the worker to participate in the <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr>. Accordingly, the employment of an Indian may be included in pensionable employment provided the following conditions are met:</p>  <ul> 
 <li>the Indian is resident in Canada for the purposes of the <em>Income Tax Act</em>; and</li> 
 <li>the employer elects to pay <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> contributions for all Indian workers.</li> 
</ul>  <p>The employer must complete, in prescribed form, a <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/cpt124.html">CPT124 -&nbsp;Application for Coverage of Employment of an Indian in Canada under the Canada Pension Plan Whose Income is Exempt under the Income Tax Act</a>.</p>  
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h3>Election by the Employee</h3>
 <p>Where the employer does not elect to cover Indian employees under the <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr>, an Indian's employment may still be included in pensionable employment provided that all of the following conditions are met:</p>  <ul> 
 <li>the employer refuses to apply for coverage for his Indian employees;</li> 
 <li>the Indian is resident in Canada for purposes of the <em>Income Tax Act</em>;</li> 
 <li>the Indian's employment is not pensionable by virtue of any other provision of the Act or Regulations;</li> 
 <li>the Indian makes an election to have his employment included as pensionable employment; and</li> 
 <li>the Indian pays within one year after April 30 of the following year the required contribution (both the employer and employee shares).</li> 
</ul>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h3>Self-Employment on a Reserve</h3>
 <p>A self-employed Indian's income from self-employment on a reserve is not included in contributory earnings for <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> purposes. However, a provision of the <em>Canada Pension Plan Regulations</em> has the effect of negating this exclusion under the <em>Canada Pension Plan</em>. Consequently, an Indian who is self-employed on a reserve can participate in the <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr>.</p>  <p>An Indian who is self-employed on a reserve and wishes to participate in the <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> must meet the following conditions:</p>  <ul> 
 <li>the income for <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> purposes is all income earned on the reserve plus any other income earned elsewhere, if applicable;</li> 
 <li>a federal income tax return (T1) is filed, although this has no bearing on the Indian's taxability for income tax purposes; and</li> 
 <li>the required contribution (both the employer and employee shares) is included with the federal tax return for the year of the pensionable employment.</li>
