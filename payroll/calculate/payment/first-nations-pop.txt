Indian Act Exemption for Employment Income Guidelines</h1>

        <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
<p>Section 87 of the <em>Indian Act</em> exempts from taxation the personal property of an Indian situated on a reserve. The courts have determined that, for the purposes of section 87 of the <em>Indian Act</em>, employment income is personal property. In the case of employment income earned by an Indian, therefore, what must be determined is whether the employment income is situated on a reserve. The courts have directed that connecting factors must be considered when making this determination. Revenue Canada, after receiving representations from interested Indian groups and individuals, has identified a number of connecting factors that can be used to determine whether employment income is situated on a reserve.</p> <p>The location of the employment duties is a major connecting factor. However, the Department also recognizes that employees of bands, tribal councils, or organizations that operate on behalf of bands or tribal councils may perform most of their activities off reserve. For the employees, the connection to a reserve is that the employer is resident on a reserve and the Indian is employed in a non-commercial activity for the social, cultural, educational, or economic development of Indians who for the most part live on reserves.</p> <p>With a view to assisting the Indian community, the Department has developed the following guidelines, incorporating the various relevant connecting factors, that describe the employment situations covered by section 87 of the <em>Indian Act</em>. The treatment of other income related to employment is also discussed.</p> <p><strong>THESE GUIDELINES ARE AN ADMINISTRATIVE TOOL TO ASSIST INDIANS IN DETERMINING WHETHER THEIR EMPLOYMENT INCOME IS EXEMPT OR NOT.</strong> </p> <p>Most employment situations that are subject to the exemption from taxation are covered in this brochure. However, it should be noted that, when applying all the connecting factors, there may be unusual or exceptional circumstances where:</p> <ol class="lst-lwr-rmn"> 
 <li>the income may not be taxable even though it does not fall within one of the guidelines; or</li> 
 <li>the income may be taxable even though it appears to fall within one of these guidelines.</li>

          <p>Mr. A works as a mechanic for an automobile repair shop, performing his duties in a garage located on a reserve. The wages he receives are exempt because the duties are performed on a reserve.</p>  <p>Mr. B lives off reserve and works as a driver for a heating-oil supplier, performing almost all of his duties making deliveries to houses on a reserve. The wages he receives are exempt because more than 90% of the duties are performed on a reserve.</p>  <p>Ms. C works in an office on a reserve. Her duties include a daily drive into a nearby town where she does the banking for the business and picks up the mail and supplies for the business.

<p>Ms. J lives on a reserve and works as an accountant at the head office of a bank located off reserve in a nearby city. The bank maintains a branch on Ms. J's reserve and arranges for her to be paid at that branch. Ms. J's employment income is taxable because the only substantive factor linking her employment income to a reserve is her residence which, without other substantial connecting factors, does not result in exemption. Payment on the reserve is viewed as a connecting factor of relatively little weight.</p>  <p>Mr. K is a construction worker employed by a corporation situated on a reserve. The corporation is an employment agency that makes employees available to work for clients that are not situated on a reserve, on building sites not located on a reserve. Mr. K lives on a reserve. The employment agency had an office on the reserve, but carried out very few of its business activities on the reserve. The guidelines would not apply in this case, and one must therefore do an analysis of the connecting factors. Mr. K's employment income is taxable because the residence of the employer in this case has little weight as a connecting factor. The only other substantive factor connecting Mr. K's employment income to a reserve is his residence, which is not sufficient to bring the employment income within the exemption.</p>
