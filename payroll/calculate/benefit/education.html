<details><summary>What is a scholarship or a bursary</summary>
<div id="ajax-scholarship">
<p>Scholarships and bursaries are amounts awarded to students, or on their behalf, to enable them to pursue their education. </p>
<p>They are not defined in the Income Tax Act, but the meaning of <strong>bursary</strong> is broad enough to include almost any form of financial assistance to enable a student to pursue their education.  </p>
<p>They can include amounts paid to cover living expenses, as well as amounts that are directly related to tuition fees. </p>
<p>They usually apply to studies at the postsecondary level or beyond, intended to obtain a university degree, a diploma or a certificate. However, there are circumstances under which they are awarded for education below the postsecondary school level. </p>
<p>Normally, a student is not expected to do specific work for the payer in exchange for a scholarship or bursary.</p>
