<details><summary>What is a scholarship, a bursary, a research grant or a fellowship</summary>
<h4>Scholarships and bursaries</h4>
<p>Scholarships and bursaries are amounts awarded to students, or on their behalf, to enable them to pursue their education. They are not defined in the Income Tax Act, but the meaning of <strong>bursary</strong> is broad enough to include almost any form of financial assistance to enable a student to pursue their education.  They can include amounts paid to defray living expenses, as well as amounts that are directly related to tuition fees. They usually apply to studies at the postsecondary level or beyond, intended to obtain a university degree, a diploma or a certificate. However, there are circumstances under which they are awarded for education below the postsecondary school level. Normally, a student is not expected to do specific work for the payer in exchange for a scholarship or bursary.</p>
<h4>Research grants</h4>
<p>Research Grants are sums of money provided to an individual for the payment of expenses necessary to conduct a research project. The grant may include personal or living expenses. The grant may also include an element of remuneration to the recipient.  Funds originating from various sources may be paid to and administered by a college, university, hospital, or similar institution where the researcher is employed. However, only that part of the grant paid to, or otherwise available for, the researcher is considered to be a research grant.</p>
<h4>Fellowship</h4>
<p>The term fellowship is not defined in the Income Tax Act. Generally, a fellowship is an amount paid or benefits given for the purpose of advancing a person’s education. It is similar to a scholarship or a bursary, with the difference being that a fellowship is generally awarded to a graduate student by a university, charity, or similar body for doctoral studies or post-doctoral work.</p>

<h3>Benefit provided to your current, former or future employee</h3>
<details><summary>Situation: You provide or reimburse for courses, programs, or training to your <strong>current or former employee</strong></summary>
<h4>Non-taxable situation</h4>
<p>Under the CRA's administrative policy, if you provide or reimburse for a course, a program, or training to your current or former employee, the benefit is <strong>not </strong>taxable if <strong>all</strong> of the following apply:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Your employee returns to work for you for a reasonable amount of time after the completion of the course, program or training, you must be able to justify your position regarding the length of the period of time being reasonable</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><p>The course, program or training is for <strong>one</strong> of the following employment-related purpose: </p>

</ul>
<p>You must be able to <strong>clearly demonstrate you are the primary beneficiary of the expense</strong>.</p>
<p>If the benefit is <strong>not</strong> taxable and you paid for the expense, your employee <strong>cannot claim </strong>the non-refundable tuition tax credit, or the educational amount, on their T1 return.</p>
<details><summary>What is specific employment-related, general employment-related or personal interest training</summary>
<p>The CRA considers there are 3 categories of training:  </p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and">
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><h5>Specific employment-related courses, programs or training   </h5> 
<div id="ajax-specific">
<p>Courses, programs or training taken to maintain or upgrade employment-related skills are mainly for the employer's benefit when it is reasonable to assume that the employee will resume their employment for a reasonable period of time after they finish the course.</p>
<p>This includes tuition fees and other associated costs such as books, meals, travel, and accommodation that employers pay for courses leading to a degree, diploma, or certificate in a field related to the employee's current or future responsibilities in the employer's business.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"> <h5>Business or general employment-related courses, programs or training </h5> 
<div id="ajax-general">
<p>Courses, programs or training for general employment-related, even if not directly related to an employer's business, which are taken mainly for the employer's benefit.</p>
<p>This includes fees the employer pays for stress management, employment equity, first aid, and language courses.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"> <h5>Personal interest courses, programs or training   </h5> 
<div id="ajax-personal">
<p>Courses, programs or training for personal interest or technical skills not related to the employer's business which are taken mainly for the employee's benefit. </p>
</div>

</ul>

<h4>Taxable situation</h4>

<details><summary>Situation: You provide or reimburse for courses, programs, or training to your <strong>future employee</strong></summary>
<h4>Non-taxable situation</h4>
<p>If you provide or reimburse for a course, a program, or training to your future employee, this is <strong>not </strong>taxable as an employee benefit because there is no employee/employer relationship between the payer and the future employee (student).</p>
<p>The individual must report the amounts received on their T1 return.</p>
<details><summary>Example</summary>
<p>A student may receive educational assistance in exchange for which they agree to work at the end of their studies or training for the person granting the financial assistance. </p>
</details>
<h5>Report on T4A slip</h5>
<p>The payer must report the full amount of the educational assistance paid on a T4A slip. If they meet certain criteria, the individual may claim the non-refundable tuition tax credit or the educational amount, on their T1 return. </p>
