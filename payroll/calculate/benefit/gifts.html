<h2 id="h_1">Determine if a benefit is taxable</h2>
<p>Generally, gifts, awards and long-service awards you provide to your employees are taxable.</p>
<p>Depending on your situation, the benefit arising from certain non-cash gifts and awards may not be taxable under the <a href="#adminpolicy" aria-controls="centred-popup" class="wb-lbx" role="button">CRA's administrative policy&nbsp;<span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a>.</p>


<details><summary>What is a "gift"</summary>
<p>A gift has to be for a special occasion such as a religious holiday, a birthday, a wedding, or the birth of a child. </p>
</details>
<details><summary>What is an "award"</summary>
<p>An award has to be for an employment-related accomplishment such as outstanding service, or employees' suggestions. It is recognition of an employee's overall contribution to the workplace, not recognition of job performance. Generally, a valid, non-taxable award has clearly defined criteria, a nomination and evaluation process, and a limited number of recipients. </p>
</details>
<details class="mrgn-bttm-md"><summary>What is a "reward"</summary>
<p>A reward is provided to your employees for performance-related reasons and is a taxable benefit for the employee. </p>

</details>
<p>If you give your employee a non-cash gift or award for any other reason, the CRA’s administrative policy does not apply and you have to include the fair market value (FMV) of the gift or award in the employee’s income.</p>

<h3 id="non">Non-taxable situation</h3>
			 
<p>Under the CRA's administrative policy, if you provide your employee with a non-cash gift (including gift cards that <a href="#giftcard" aria-controls="centred-popup" class="wb-lbx" role="button">meet all conditions for the card to be considered non-cash&nbsp;<span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a>) or an award, the benefit is not taxable if <strong>all</strong> of the following apply:</p>

<div id="ajax-giftcard"> 
<p id="new"> Under the CRA's administrative policy, if you provide your employee with gift cards, the gift card is considered non-cash if <strong>all</strong> of the following apply:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and mrgn-bttm-lg">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">It comes with money already on it and can <strong>only </strong>be used to purchase goods or services from a <strong>single retailer or a group of retailers identified on the card</strong> </li>

<p>This includes gift certificates, chip cards and electronic gift cards. If the gift card meets all these conditions, it is considered non-cash for the purpose of the CRA's administrative policy. If the card does not meet these conditions, it is considered a near-cash benefit and is taxable.</p>

<p>You <strong>must </strong>review the <strong>terms and conditions </strong>of the gift card to make sure it meets the conditions of the CRA's administrative policy above. You <strong>must </strong>complete this review on a <strong>case by case </strong>basis.</p>

<p> Under the updated CRA's administrative policy, if you provide your employee with a long-service award, the benefit is not taxable if <strong>all</strong> of the following apply:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and mrgn-bttm-lg">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">It is a non-cash gift or award, including gift cards that <a href="#giftcard" aria-controls="centred-popup" class="wb-lbx" role="button">meet all conditions for the card to be considered non-cash&nbsp;<span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a> </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">It is a recognition of five or more years of service with the employer </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">It has been at least five years since the last time the employer gave the employee a long-term service award </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The FMV of the award is <strong>$500 or less (including taxes)</strong> </li></ul>
 <h3>Taxable situation</h3>
<p>If the long-service awards you provide to your employees do not meet all of the conditions above, it is a taxable benefit.</p>			
<p>Long-service awards have their own $500 limit. The unused portion of the $500 limit for long-service awards cannot be applied to non-cash gifts and awards.</p>


<details class="mrgn-bttm-md">
		 <summary>Example</summary>
<p>If the 15 year award was provided at 17 years of service, and then the next award is provided at 20 years of service, the 20 year award is a taxable benefit because five years will not have passed since the previous award.</p>

<details ><summary>Situation: Gifts and awards you donate to a charitable organization at your employee's direction</summary>
<p id="donate">The CRA's administrative policy may apply in this situation. Generally, amounts that are not received or enjoyed by a taxpayer are taxable when the payment is transferred to another person at the direction or with the concurrence of the taxpayer. However the CRA's administrative policy may apply if the employee's donation meets <strong>all of the following conditions</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>had the option of receiving a <a href="#non">non-cash gift or award </a> or a <a href="#long">Long-service award</a></li>
<li>chose to have the employer directly donate the amount to a charity in lieu of the non-cash gift or award </li>
<li>the gift or award, if it had been received, would have met the conditions under the policy </li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of whether the donation is a non-cash gift or an award <strong>or </strong>a long-service award, any amount over the $500 limit is taxable.</p>

</ul>

<h4 id="manu1">Gifts and awards from a manufacturer passed on by the dealer</h4>
<p>Manufacturers sometimes provide a gift or award to the dealer of the goods for the dealer to pass on to their employee. If the dealer passes a non-cash award to an employee, the benefit may not be taxable, depending on the circumstances. The gift or award is treated as though it was provided by the dealer to their employee. If the gift or award falls within our administrative policy, the benefit is not taxable.</p><p> To determine if taxable, refer to: <a href="#non">Non-cash gifts or awards provided to your employees</a></p>

<h4 id="manu2">Gifts and awards from a manufacturer provided directly to an employee of the dealer</h4>
<p>When gifts and awards are provided directly by a manufacturer to an employee, the benefit is <strong>not </strong>reported by the employer. </p>
<h5>Manufacturer reports the benefit on a slip</h5>
<p>If the total value of all remuneration (gifts, awards and other payments) provided by the manufacturer to the dealer's employee is <strong>more than $500</strong> (under the CRA administrative policy for issuing T4A slips), the <strong>manufacturer has to report</strong> the value of the benefit on a T4A slip at the end of the year as follows:</p>

<p>If any tax was deducted, it should be reported in box 22 of the T4A slip.</p>

<h4 id="manu3">Gifts and awards provided by a person other than the employer (for example, gift bag provided at a trade show)</h4>
<p>If the gifts and awards are provided by a person other than the employer the benefit is <strong>not </strong>taxable if <strong>all</strong> of the following apply:</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
  <li class="cnjnctn-col">Recipients attend a trade show, convention, awards show, or similar event specific to their trade </li>

<h5>Payer reports the benefit on a slip</h5>
<p>If the total value of all remuneration (gifts, awards and other payments) provided by the payer is <strong>more than $500</strong> (under the CRA administrative policy for issuing T4A slips), the <strong>payer has to report</strong> the value of the benefit on a T4A slip at the end of the year as follows:</p>

		 <h3>Non-taxable situation - Social committees funded entirely by the employees</h3>
		 
<p>If the committee is funded entirely by the employees and not controlled by the employer:</p>

<ul>
<li>gifts or awards given by the social committee are non-taxable, similar to a return of contributions </li>
<li>a prize won via lottery from a social committee is considered to be a windfall </li>

<h4>Taxable situation - Social committees funded wholly or partly by the employer</h4>

</details>
			 
<h2 id="h_2">Calculate the value of the benefit</h2>

<p><strong>If the benefit is taxable</strong>, the value of the benefit is equal to the combined total fair market value (FMV) of the gifts and awards provided in the year.</p>

<p>Where our policy on non-cash gifts and awards applies, only amounts over the $500 limit must be included in the employee's income.</p>
<p>For example, if you provide gifts and awards with a total value of $650, there is a taxable benefit of $150 ($650 – $500). Include items whose FMV may have been altered by a logo or engraving in the calculation.</p>
<h3 id="h_3_1">Do not include</h3>
<p><strong>Do not </strong>include the following in the $500 limit:</p>

<ul class="fa-ul">
<li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span> small items or items of a trivial value such as coffee or tea, T-shirts, mugs, plaques and trophies </li>
