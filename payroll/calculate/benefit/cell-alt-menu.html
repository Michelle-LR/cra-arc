<h2 id="h_1">Determine if a benefit is taxable</h2>
<p class="mrgn-bttm-lg">Generally, cell phones and internet services you provide to your employees are taxable. Depending on your situation, the benefit may not be taxable under the <a href="#adminpolicy" aria-controls="centred-popup" class="wb-lbx" role="button">CRA's administrative policy&nbsp;<span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a>. </p>
<details><summary>Situation: Allowances you provide to your employees for cell phone and internet services</summary>
<p>The CRA's administrative policy does not apply if you give your employees an <strong> allowance</strong> for cell phone and internet services. The benefit received is <strong>always</strong> taxable.
	 </p>

<p>To calculate the benefit, refer to: <a href="#h_2">Calculate the value of the benefit</a></p> 
</details>





<details><summary>Situation: Cell phones you provide to your employees</summary>

<p>Under the CRA's administrative policy, if you provide your employee with a cell phone (or other handheld communication device) that you own and you require your employee to use the cell phone as part of their employment duties, the fair market value (FMV) of the cell phone or device is <strong>not </strong>a taxable benefit.</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Situation: Cell phone service plans you provide or reimburse to your employees </summary>


<h3>Non-taxable situation</h3>
<p id="yes"> Under the CRA's administrative policy, if you provide an employee with cell phone service plans, the FMV of the benefit is <strong>not </strong>taxable if <strong>all</strong> of the following apply: </p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and mrgn-bttm-lg">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">You require your employee to use the cell phone service plans as part of their employment duties </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The plan has a reasonable <strong>fixed cost</strong> </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Your employee's personal use of the service <strong>does not result in additional charges </strong>(the total charges are not more than the plan cost)  </li>
</ul>
	 <h5>Records to keep</h5>
<p>You must also be prepared to justify your position regarding the cost of the plan being reasonable. When determining whether a plan is reasonable or not, judgement should be made in respect of the employee's employment related needs. A more expensive plan may be considered reasonable if the employee requires that service in order to perform their regular duties of employment. </p>	
	 <h3>Taxable situation</h3>
<p>If the cell phone service plans do not meet all of the conditions above, it is a taxable benefit.</p>			  
<p>Where additional charges are incurred in excess of the price of the plan </strong>as a result of the employee's <strong>personal use</strong>, it is a taxable benefit unless the employee reimburses you for the additional charges.</p>

<p>To calculate the benefit, refer to: <a href="#h_2">Calculate the value of the benefit</a></p> 

		
</details>
<details><summary>Situation: Cell phones purchased by the employee and you reimbursed them</summary>

<p>The CRA's administrative policy does not apply if you reimburse your employee for the cost of their own cell phone (or other handheld communication device). The FMV of the cell phone or device is a taxable benefit. This is the case even if the employee used, lost, or damaged the cell phone or device while carrying out their employment duties. </p>
<h3>Taxable situation</h3>
<p>If the plan cost includes both the purchase of the phone and service, <strong>and the plan meets all conditions</strong>, only the part for the purchase of the phone is a taxable benefit.</p>
<p>For the conditions, refer to: <a href="#yes">Cell phone service plans you provide or reimburse to your employees</a></p>

<details><summary>Situation: Long distance phone calls you reimburse to your employees</summary>


<h3>Non-taxable situation</h3>
<p> Under the CRA's administrative policy, if you reimburse your employee for personal long distance telephone calls, the benefit is <strong>not </strong>taxable if <strong>one </strong>of the following apply:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm"> 
  <li class="cnjnctn-col">They relate to selling the employee's old residence <strong>and </strong>they are in respect of the moving or relocation of the employee, the employee's family, and their household effects to one of the employer's places of business</li>

<p>An employee works a lot from home or on the road. The employee <strong>already owns </strong>the cell phone and uses it to perform their employment duties.
