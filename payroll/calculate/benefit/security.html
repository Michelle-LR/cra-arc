<li><h3 id="step2">Determine if the stock option agreement is considered received by virtue of employment</h3>
<p>To determine if the stock option agreement is considered received by virtue of employement, you need to determine if there is an agreement between:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or">
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><p>You as a qualifying person (corporation or a mutual trust fund), including if you are in <strong>one</strong> of the following situation:</p>

<details><summary>You are a non-resident corporation</summary>
<h4 class="mrgn-tp-md text-muted h4">By virtue of employment</h4>
<p>If the stock option agreement is between a qualifying person who is a non-resident corporation and your employee is working in Canada (or employed in Canada by a corporation with which the non-resident corporation does not deal at arm’s length), the benefit is considered received by <strong>virtue of employment</strong> under section 7. </p>

<details><summary>Example</summary>
<p>On March 7, an employee is granted 100 options to purchase shares of their employer's parent corporation at the FMV of $10 US ($1 US = $1.35 CDN). </p>
<p>On September 2 the employee informs their employer that they wish to exercise their 100 options and pays the employer $1000 US ($1 US = $1.25 CDN). The exercise price is $10 US and the FMV is $20 US on this date. </p>
<p>On September 5 the treasury shares are transferred to the employee at a FMV of $19 US ($1 US = $1.20 CDN). </p>
</details>
</details>

<details><summary>You are using a trustee as an intermediary</summary>
<h4 class="mrgn-tp-md text-muted h4">By virtue of employment</h4>
<p>If the stock option agreement is between a qualifying person who is using a truste as an intermediary and the person receiving the benefit is your employee, the benefit is considered received by <strong>virtue of employment</strong> under subsection 7(2).</p>
<details><summary>Example</summary>
<h5>Description</h5>
<p>Ashley is granted 10,000 options on March 4, 2014, when the FMV of each share is $20. Ashley must be an employee for at least three years after date of exercise before the shares are fully vested, or the employer may buy back the shares for $0.01 each. Ashley exercises her option on May 1, 2015, when the FMV of each share is $25. In 2015, Ashley's benefit is equal to $50,000 [10,000 x (25-20)], and this amount is reported on her T4.</p>
<p>On June 1, 2016, Ashley leaves the company, and as a result, forfeits her securities, and receives $100 in consideration for the $50,000 of shares. There are no changes to Ashley's T4 for 2014, 2015, or 2016, but when Ashley files her tax return, she may, in the year in which she forfeited the securities, claim a deduction of $50,000 from her income.</p>
</details>
</details>

</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><p>The person receiving the benefit is in <strong>one</strong> of the following situation:</p>

<details><summary>Your employee</summary>
<h4 class="mrgn-tp-md text-muted h4">By virtue of employment</h4>
<p>If the stock option agreement is between a qualifying person and the person is your employee, the benefit is considered received by <strong>virtue of employment</strong> under section 7.</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Person ceased to be your employee</summary>
<h4 class="mrgn-tp-md text-muted h4">By virtue of employment</h4>
<p>If the stock option agreement is between a qualifying person and the person ceased to be your employee, the benefit is considered received by <strong>virtue of employment</strong> under subsection 7(4). </p>
<details><summary>Example</summary>
<h5>Description</h5>
<ul>
<li>A person had the option to purchase 10,000 shares of ABC Inc. when the employment began. </li>
<li>On November 30, 2020, the person employment ceased when they resigned from his position as Manager. </li>
<li>A clause in the stock option agreement allowed the person to purchase these shares within a period of 90 calendar days after the date of termination.</li>
<li>On January 20, 2021, the person chose to purchase 20,000 shares at the price of $.50 cents per share.</li></ul>
<h5>Result</h5>
<p>Although the person's employment ceased on November 30, 2020, any benefit from the purchase of shares in ABC Inc. on January 20, 2021 is considered taxable under subsection 7(1). </p>
</details>
<details><summary>Explanation</summary>
<p>If a person was your employee at the time of receiving a right to acquire shares, but subsequently ceases to be your employee (for example, change jobs or retire) before the exercise or transfer of that right, the person is treated as your employee until the transaction is completed. The benefit is included in their employment income and the person is deemed to have received the benefit as if they are still employed.</p>
</details>
</details>

<details><summary>Your employee is also a shareholder</summary>
<h4 class="mrgn-tp-md text-muted h4">Not by virtue of employment</h4>
<p>If the stock option agreement is between a qualifying person and your employee is also a shareholder, the benefit is <strong>not </strong>considered received by virtue of employment under subsection 7(5) if <strong>all</strong> of the following apply:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Benefit is a distribution of profits</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Similar benefits are not available to employees who were not shareholders</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Duties of other employees <strong>not</strong> equally important</li>
</ul>

<details><summary>Example - Not considered received by virtue of employment</summary>
<h5>Description</h5>
<ul>
<li>A person is president of ABC Inc. </li>
<li>They own 51% of that corporation's common voting shares.</li>
<li>The person's spouse owns 10%. </li>
<li>The person and his spouse are the only people with a stock option agreement from ABC Inc. </li>
<li>The plan was not offered to any other employee. </li></ul>
<h5>Result</h5>
<p>The person is in a position of control. The person and the spouse receive the benefit because of his capacity as a shareholder. </p>
<p>This is <strong>not</strong> taxable as an employee benefit because it is <strong>not</strong> considered to be received by virtue of employment. </p>
</details>
<details><summary>Factors to consider to determine if the individual received the shares in their capacity as a shareholder <strong>or</strong> as your employee</summary>
<p>If your employee is also a shareholder, it is a question of fact whether the individual received the shares in their capacity as a shareholder <strong>or</strong> as your employee. </p>
<p>You need to determine if the benefit resulted from the individual's role as an employee or their role as a shareholder. In addition to control, other factors must be considered.</p>
<p>Factors to be considered based on court cases includes: </p> 
<ul>
<li>Was the benefit given to the taxpayer pursuant to a worker agreement with the corporation?</li>
<li>Was the benefit given pursuant to a formal agreement with the corporation?</li>
<li>Was the benefit given to reimburse costs of fees incurred by the taxpayer?</li>
<li>Was the same benefit offered to other workers, officers or directors?</li>
<li>Was the stock options or discretionary dividend shares?</li>
<li>Did clients of the corporation receive the same benefit?</li>
<li>Did the taxpayer owned 50% or more of the corporation's shares?</li>
<li>Did the corporation receive fair market value for the benefit from the taxpayer?</li>
<li>Does the benefit relate to the performance of the taxpayer’s duties at the corporation?</li>
<li>Was the benefit given to entertain clients or potential clients?</li>
<li>Did the corporation give the benefit to pay off a debt owed to the taxpayer?</li></ul>
</details>

<h4 class="mrgn-tp-md text-muted h4">By virtue of employment</h4>
<p>If the stock option agreement <strong> does not</strong> meet <strong>all</strong> conditions above, the benefit is considered received by <strong>virtue of employment</strong>.</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Self-employed person</summary>

<details><summary>Example - Not considered received by virtue of employment</summary>
<h5>Description</h5>
<ul>
<li>A person is a self-employed consultant.</li>
<li>The person is contracted on a short-term basis by a junior public mining corporation to raise capital.</li>
<li>Part of the contract, the person was offered participation in the corporation's stock option benefit plan with details outlined in a stock option agreement.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Result</h5>
<p>The person was not an employee of the junior public mining corporation. </p>
<p>This is <strong>not</strong> taxable as an employee benefit because it is <strong>not</strong> considered to be received by virtue of employment. </p>

<p>The benefit is taxable when <strong>one</strong> of the following applies:</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Your employee acquires, purchases or receives the securities at less than the <a href="#def-fmv" aria-controls="centred-popup" class="wb-lbx" role="button">fair marker value (FMV)&nbsp;<span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a></li>

</ul>

<h4>Event that caused a benefit</h4>

<details><summary>Employee chooses to <strong>exercises their rights </strong>and <strong>acquires the shares </strong> [7(1)(a)]
</summary>
<p id="event1">This applies when your employee chooses to <a href="#def-exercise" aria-controls="centred-popup" class="wb-lbx" role="button">excercise&nbsp;<span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a> their rights under the agreement and acquire the securities. An acquisition is considered to take place when:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Title to the shares passes to your employee </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The employer has legal right to payment for the shares </li>
</ul>
<p>Generally, your employee notifies the employer that they wishes to exercise their options to acquire shares.</p>

<details><summary> Security option is exercised for preferred shares and a share is acquired, including shares convertible to common shares</summary>
<p>Where an employee acquires convertible preferred shares, they are taxable as employee benefits because the benefits are considered to be received by virtue of employment under 7(1)(a) of the ITA.  </p>
<h4>Explanation</h4>
<p>Convertible preferred shares are preferred shares of a corporation that are convertible to common shares of the corporation. Convertible preferred shares include forward participating shares. Forward participating shares are generally those shares of a separate class of a corporation that are purchased by the individual for fair market value consideration. The forward participating shares derive most of their value from their convertibility into common shares of the corporation.</p>
<p>Pursuant to an agreement between an employee and the employer corporation, or a corporation with which it does not deal at arm's length, the initial acquisition of preferred shares to which a conversion feature is attached is no different than the acquisition of any other shares of the capital stock of the corporation.</p>
<p>Paragraph 7(1)(a) deems a benefit equal to the difference between the value of the shares at the date of acquisition and the amount paid or to be paid for the shares to have been received by your employee in the taxation year in which the shares are acquired. In the case of a CCPC, the benefit is deferred until your employee disposes of the acquired share.</p>
<p>The value of the shares at the date of acquisition may not be readily determinable because of the necessity to assign a value to the conversion feature, or to allow a discount for any restrictions that the conversion feature may impose.</p>
</details>

<details><summary> Security option is exercised, a share is acquired and sold on before the share is received by your employee (short selling) </summary>
<p>Short selling transactions are taxable as employee benefits because the benefits are considered to be received by virtue of employment under 7(1)(a) of the ITA.  </p>
<h4>Explanation</h4>
<p>The concept of short selling can be best illustrated with the following example. An employee exercises a stock option and at the same time instructs their broker to sell the shares on the market immediately. The actual transactions are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your employee notifies the corporation in writing June 30, 2018, that they wish to exercise the stock options. </li>
<li>On the same notification that your employee sends to the corporation, your employee authorizes their broker to sell the shares obtained upon the exercise of the options and to pay the corporation the exercise price for the shares. </li>
<li>The broker immediately sells shares of the corporation on the open market (June 30). This, however, is a so-called "short sale" because the corporation has not, and will not, actually issue shares from treasury to the broker (the agent of your employee) until it is paid the exercise price by the broker. </li>
<li>The broker sells the shares on the trade date (June 30), obtains cash, and then, generally, a few days later, pays the corporation the exercise price on your employee's behalf. On July 3, 2018, your employee receives the treasury shares from the corporation (this covers the broker's position in respect of the shares that it sold "short" a few days earlier). </li>
</ul>
<p>July 3rd is the date the shares are "acquired" for purposes of calculating the taxable benefit.</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Situation: Employee acquires shares from a <strong>non-CCPC</strong> employer</summary>
<h4>Taxable situation</h4>
<p>If your employee acquires shares under a security options agreement entered into by a non-CCPC, the benefit is taxable.</p>

<p>The benefit is taxable <strong>in the year in which your employee acquires the shares</strong>under 7(1)(a).</p>

</details>

<details><summary>Situation: Employee acquires shares from a <strong>CCPC</strong>,  including employers who was a CCPC at the time the security option agreement was entered into and subsequently ceased to be one</summary>
<h4>Taxable situation</h4>

<p>If your employee acquires shares under a security options agreement entered into by a CCPC, the benefit is taxable.</p>

<p>The benefit is taxable <strong>in the year in which your employee disposes of the shares</strong> under 7(1.1).</p>

</details>

</details>

<details><summary>Employee <strong>transfers or disposes of rights </strong>to a person with whom your employee was <strong>dealing at arm's length </strong> or to the particular <strong>qualifying person </strong>with whom your employee was <strong>not dealing at arm's length </strong>, including security option cash outs [7(1)(b) or 7(1)(b.1)]</summary>
<p id="event2">This applies in <strong>one </strong>of the following situations:</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">There is a significant change in the terms of the security option agreement that resulted in a disposition of the option </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Your employee has disposed of security option rights to a third party as part of a transaction that results in an ownership change in the corporation </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Your employee received cash, or other in-kind benefit, from their employer instead of shares on exercise of an option. This is often referred to as "cash out". </li>
</ul>
<p>This also applies when your employee is deemed to have received a benefit when they dispose of rights under a security option agreement to an employer with which your employee does not deal at arm's length (or to a person not dealing at arm's length with such an employer), including cash outs.</p>
<details><summary>Situation: Employee <strong>disposes</strong> of their rights under the security option agreement and the <strong>employer </strong>elects to cash out the rights</summary>

<li class="cnjnctn-col">Employee <strong>chooses </strong>to receive shares in lieu of a cash bonus already declared by the employer </li>
</ul>
<p>The benefit is taxable <strong>on the date the security option was cashed out </strong>under 5(1) or 6(1)(a). This is because your employee received cash, or other in-kind benefit, from their employer instead of shares on exercise of an option. The security option cash out <strong>cannot </strong>be deferred.</p>
<details><summary>Examples</summary>
<ul>
<li>An employer offers an annual bonus when key corporate objectives have been met.  Although your employee doesn't know whether the objectives will be met this year, your employee advised their employer that, if he is entitled to a bonus, he wants to take shares of the corporation instead of receiving a cash bonus.  Section 7 will apply in this situation. </li>
<li>If your employee waits until the bonus is declared and then opts to take shares instead of the cash payment, the value of the shares your employee receives will be taxed as employment income under 5(1) or 6(1)(a). Section 7 would not apply in this situation. </li>
</ul>

<p>When calculating the taxable benefit, the foreign stock options must be converted to the Canadian dollar equivalent. </p>

<p>Where the amount paid or to be paid by an employee pursuant to the terms of a stock option agreement is expressed in terms of a foreign currency, it will not compromise your employee's eligibility for the deduction under paragraph 110(1)(d).</p>

However there may be circumstances where this may not be the case. Specifically the fair market value of a security is the price that can be obtainable in an open and unrestricted market between knowledgeable, informed and prudent parties acting at arm's length where neither party is under any compulsion to purchase or sell the security. </div></dd>
