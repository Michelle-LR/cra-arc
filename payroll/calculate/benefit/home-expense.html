</li>

<li class="cnjnctn-col"><h4>Using higher or lower amount </h4>
<div id="ajax-rates2">
<p>Generally, if you use an amount to cover your employee’s home office expenses for using their own home as part of their employment duties, it is considered reasonable. </p>
<p>If you use an amount that is <strong>lower or higher</strong> than the amount, it may <strong>not</strong> be considered reasonable. </p>
<p><strong>All of the facts</strong> relevant to your employee’s situation must be considered to determine if a lower or higher amount is considered reasonable. For example, factors such as the type of building, or a higher hydro cost at a specific location, may be situations where you determine that the reasonable amounts are higher or lower.</p>

<p>If you think that your employee’s situation justifies using an amount that is lower or higher than the CRA administrative policy but you are not sure if the CRA will accept it, you can ask for an advance income tax ruling that is binding on the CRA. </p>
<p>However, if you pay your employee an allowance based on an amount that is <strong>not</strong> considered reasonable in the situation, the allowance is taxable.</p>
