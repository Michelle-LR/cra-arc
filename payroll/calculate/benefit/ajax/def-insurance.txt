<p>A <strong>group term life insurance policy </strong>is one for which the only amounts payable by the insurer are policy dividends, experience rating refunds, and amounts payable on the death or disability of an employee, former employee, retired employee, or their covered dependants.</p>
<p><strong>Term insurance </strong>is any life insurance under a group term life insurance policy other than insurance for which a lump-sum premium has become payable or has been paid. Life insurance for current employees would usually be term insurance, although it is sometimes provided for retired employees.</p>
<p>A <strong>lump-sum premium </strong>is a premium for insurance on an individual's life where all or part of the premium is for insurance for a period that extends more than 13 months after the payment of the premium (or more than 13 months after the time the premium became payable, if it is paid after it became payable).</p>
