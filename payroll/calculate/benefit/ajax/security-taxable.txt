<li class="cnjnctn-col">Title to the shares passes to your employee </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The employer has legal right to payment for the shares </li>

<div id="ajax-taxable2">
<p id="event2">This applies in <strong>one </strong>of the following situations:</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">There is a significant change in the terms of the security option agreement that resulted in a disposition of the option </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Your employee has disposed of security option rights to a third party as part of a transaction that results in an ownership change in the corporation </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Your employee received cash, or other in-kind benefit, from their employer instead of shares on exercise of an option. This is often referred to as "cash out". </li>
</ul>
<p>This also applies when your employee is deemed to have received a benefit when they dispose of rights under a security option agreement to an employer with which your employee does not deal at arm's length (or to a person not dealing at arm's length with such an employer), including cash outs.</p>
<details><summary>Situation: Employee <strong>disposes</strong> of their rights under the security option agreement and the <strong>employer </strong>elects to cash out the rights</summary>
<h4>Taxable situation</h4>
<p>The benefit is taxable if: </p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Employee <strong>disposes of their rights </strong>under the security option agreement </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Employee has the <strong>option </strong>of receiving shares or cash </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><strong>Employer </strong>elects to cash out the rights </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Employee <strong>chooses </strong>to receive shares in lieu of a cash bonus already declared by the employer </li>
</ul>
<p>The benefit is taxable <strong>on the date the security option was cashed out </strong>under 5(1) or 6(1)(a). This is because your employee received cash, or other in-kind benefit, from their employer instead of shares on exercise of an option. The security option cash out <strong>cannot </strong>be deferred.</p>
<details><summary>Examples</summary>
<ul>
<li>An employer offers an annual bonus when key corporate objectives have been met.  Although your employee doesn't know whether the objectives will be met this year, your employee advised their employer that, if he is entitled to a bonus, he wants to take shares of the corporation instead of receiving a cash bonus.  Section 7 will apply in this situation. </li>
<li>If your employee waits until the bonus is declared and then opts to take shares instead of the cash payment, the value of the shares your employee receives will be taxed as employment income under 5(1) or 6(1)(a). Section 7 would not apply in this situation. </li>
</ul>
</details>
<p><span class="fas fa-ban text-danger fa-lg"></span> Your employee is <strong>not </strong>eligible to claim any deductions because it is <strong>not </strong>considered to have been received under section 7 (by virtue of employment).</p>
