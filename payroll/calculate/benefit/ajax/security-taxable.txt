<details><summary>7(1)(a)</summary>
<div id="ajax-taxable1">
<p id="event1">This applies when your employee chooses to <a href="#def-exercise" aria-controls="centred-popup" class="wb-lbx" role="button">excercise&nbsp;<span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a> their rights under the agreement and acquire the securities. An acquisition is considered to take place when:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Title to the shares passes to your employee </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">The employer has legal right to payment for the shares </li>
</ul>
<p>Generally, your employee notifies the employer that they wishes to exercise their options to acquire shares.</p>

<details><summary> Security option is exercised for preferred shares and a share is acquired, including shares convertible to common shares</summary>
<p>Where an employee acquires convertible preferred shares, they are taxable as employee benefits because the benefits are considered to be received by virtue of employment under 7(1)(a) of the ITA.  </p>
<h4>Explanation</h4>
<p>Convertible preferred shares are preferred shares of a corporation that are convertible to common shares of the corporation. Convertible preferred shares include forward participating shares. Forward participating shares are generally those shares of a separate class of a corporation that are purchased by the individual for fair market value consideration. The forward participating shares derive most of their value from their convertibility into common shares of the corporation.</p>
<p>Pursuant to an agreement between an employee and the employer corporation, or a corporation with which it does not deal at arm's length, the initial acquisition of preferred shares to which a conversion feature is attached is no different than the acquisition of any other shares of the capital stock of the corporation.</p>
<p>Paragraph 7(1)(a) deems a benefit equal to the difference between the value of the shares at the date of acquisition and the amount paid or to be paid for the shares to have been received by your employee in the taxation year in which the shares are acquired. In the case of a CCPC, the benefit is deferred until your employee disposes of the acquired share.</p>
<p>The value of the shares at the date of acquisition may not be readily determinable because of the necessity to assign a value to the conversion feature, or to allow a discount for any restrictions that the conversion feature may impose.</p>
</details>

<details><summary> Security option is exercised, a share is acquired and sold on before the share is received by your employee (short selling) </summary>
<p>Short selling transactions are taxable as employee benefits because the benefits are considered to be received by virtue of employment under 7(1)(a) of the ITA.  </p>
<h4>Explanation</h4>
<p>The concept of short selling can be best illustrated with the following example. An employee exercises a stock option and at the same time instructs their broker to sell the shares on the market immediately. The actual transactions are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your employee notifies the corporation in writing June 30, 2018, that they wish to exercise the stock options. </li>
<li>On the same notification that your employee sends to the corporation, your employee authorizes their broker to sell the shares obtained upon the exercise of the options and to pay the corporation the exercise price for the shares. </li>
<li>The broker immediately sells shares of the corporation on the open market (June 30). This, however, is a so-called "short sale" because the corporation has not, and will not, actually issue shares from treasury to the broker (the agent of your employee) until it is paid the exercise price by the broker. </li>
<li>The broker sells the shares on the trade date (June 30), obtains cash, and then, generally, a few days later, pays the corporation the exercise price on your employee's behalf. On July 3, 2018, your employee receives the treasury shares from the corporation (this covers the broker's position in respect of the shares that it sold "short" a few days earlier). </li>
</ul>
<p>July 3rd is the date the shares are "acquired" for purposes of calculating the taxable benefit.</p>

<details><summary>Situation: Employee acquires shares from a <strong>non-CCPC</strong> employer</summary>
<h4>Taxable situation</h4>
<p>If your employee acquires shares under a security options agreement entered into by a non-CCPC, the benefit is taxable.</p>
<p>The benefit is taxable <strong>in the year in which your employee acquires the shares</strong>under 7(1)(a).</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Situation: Employee acquires shares from a <strong>CCPC</strong>,  including employers who was a CCPC at the time the security option agreement was entered into and subsequently ceased to be one</summary>
<h4>Taxable situation</h4>
<p>If your employee acquires shares under a security options agreement entered into by a CCPC, the benefit is taxable.</p>
<p>The benefit is taxable <strong>in the year in which your employee disposes of the shares</strong> under 7(1.1).</p>

<details><summary>7(1)(b) or 7(1)(b.1)</summary>
<div id="ajax-taxable2">
<p id="event2">This applies in <strong>one </strong>of the following situations:</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">There is a significant change in the terms of the security option agreement that resulted in a disposition of the option </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Your employee has disposed of security option rights to a third party as part of a transaction that results in an ownership change in the corporation </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Your employee received cash, or other in-kind benefit, from their employer instead of shares on exercise of an option. This is often referred to as "cash out". </li>
</ul>
<p>This also applies when your employee is deemed to have received a benefit when they dispose of rights under a security option agreement to an employer with which your employee does not deal at arm's length (or to a person not dealing at arm's length with such an employer), including cash outs.</p>
<details><summary>Situation: Employee <strong>disposes</strong> of their rights under the security option agreement and the <strong>employer </strong>elects to cash out the rights</summary>
<h4>Taxable situation</h4>
<p>The benefit is taxable if: </p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Employee <strong>disposes of their rights </strong>under the security option agreement </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Employee has the <strong>option </strong>of receiving shares or cash </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><strong>Employer </strong>elects to cash out the rights </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Employee <strong>chooses </strong>to receive shares in lieu of a cash bonus already declared by the employer </li>
</ul>
<p>The benefit is taxable <strong>on the date the security option was cashed out </strong>under 5(1) or 6(1)(a). This is because your employee received cash, or other in-kind benefit, from their employer instead of shares on exercise of an option. The security option cash out <strong>cannot </strong>be deferred.</p>
<details><summary>Examples</summary>
<ul>
<li>An employer offers an annual bonus when key corporate objectives have been met.  Although your employee doesn't know whether the objectives will be met this year, your employee advised their employer that, if he is entitled to a bonus, he wants to take shares of the corporation instead of receiving a cash bonus.  Section 7 will apply in this situation. </li>
<li>If your employee waits until the bonus is declared and then opts to take shares instead of the cash payment, the value of the shares your employee receives will be taxed as employment income under 5(1) or 6(1)(a). Section 7 would not apply in this situation. </li>
</ul>

<li class="cnjnctn-col">Employee does not derive an economic gain from the exchange </li>
</ul>
<p>The original option is deemed under 7(1.4) of the ITA to have not been disposed of and the new option is deemed to be the same as and a continuation of the old option. A taxable benefit will only arise when the new option has been exercised or otherwise disposed of by your employee.</p>
