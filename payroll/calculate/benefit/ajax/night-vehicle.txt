<p id="detcalc">Under the CRA's administrative policy, you can use the <a href="#oper-rates" aria-controls="centred-popup" class="wb-lbx" role="button">fixed rate&nbsp;<span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a> calculation for the value of the motor vehicle benefit if <strong>all</strong> of the following conditions of the <strong>motor vehicle home at night policy</strong> apply:</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and">
<li class="cnjnctn-col"> The vehicle is <strong>not</strong> an automobile.</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"> You tell your employee in writing that they cannot make any personal driving of the vehicle, other than travelling between work and home. Your employee kept <a href="#log" aria-controls="centred-popup" class="wb-lbx" role="button">records&nbsp;<span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a> of the vehicle’s use as proof that there was no other personal driving.</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"> You have valid business reasons for making the employee take the vehicle home at night, for example:
<ul class="fa-ul">
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li fa-lg text-success"></span> It would not be safe to leave tools and equipment at your premises or at a worksite overnight. </li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li fa-lg text-success"></span> Your employee is on call to respond to emergencies (the CRA generally considers an emergency to relate to either health and safety of the general population or to a significant disruption to the employer's operations), and you provide the vehicle so the employee can respond more effectively to emergencies. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"> The motor vehicle is specifically designed or suited for your business or trade and is essential for the performance of your employee's duties, for example:

<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li fa-lg text-success"></span> The vehicle is designed, or significantly modified, to carry tools, equipment, or merchandise. Your employee has to have the vehicle to do their job. </li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li fa-lg text-success"></span> The vehicle, such as a pickup truck or a van, is suitable for and is consistently used to carry and store heavy, bulky, or numerous tools and equipment.

<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li fa-lg text-success"></span> The vehicle is regularly used to carry harmful or foul-smelling material, such as veterinary samples or fish and game. The vehicle is essential to your employee in performing their job. </li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li fa-lg text-success"></span> Your employee is on call for emergencies, and has to use a vehicle which:
<ul>
<li>is a clearly marked emergency response vehicle. </li>
<li>is specially equipped to respond rapidly.</li>
<li>is designed to carry specialized equipment to the scene of an emergency. </li>
</ul>

<details><summary> Examples</summary>
<h4>Example 1</h4>
<p>ABC Restaurant Inc. uses a van that has been specially modified so it can be used more efficiently to transport and deliver food orders. The employer has asked the manager, Leslie, to take the van home at night in case she needs to respond to an emergency at the restaurant, such as an after hour alarm or to fill in on busy nights. Leslie is not allowed to use the van for any other personal use. Since she is the manager, her employment duties do not include delivering food orders, even on a busy night.</p>

<p>ABC Restaurant cannot use the lower fixed rate (33 cents per kilometre) when calculating Leslie's taxable benefit. These circumstances do not meet all of the conditions of the administrative policy. Although the vehicle has been modified for business needs, Leslie does not need the van to perform her employment duties, so she does not have to bring it home for valid business reasons.</p>
<h4>Example 2</h4>
<p>Mary works for a gas utility company and has to be on-call two weekends out of every month. On these weekends, she has to be able to respond to emergencies directly from her home. The van, which the employer provides Mary for these weekends, displays the company's name, has a light on the roof and has been permanently modified to carry specialized equipment to the scene of the emergencies. The company has a written policy prohibiting any other personal use of these vehicles, other than driving between the worksite and home. Mary has not used the vehicle for any other personal driving.</p>
<p>Since this situation meets all of the conditions of the administrative policy, Mary's employer may calculate the personal use of the vehicle using the reduced rate of 33 cents per kilometre.</p>
