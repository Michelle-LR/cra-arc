	<p>FMV is the highest price that can be obtained in an open market between an informed and willing buyer and an informed and willing seller who are dealing at arm's length.</p>
<p>The FMV of property or a service does not include GST/HST.</p>
<p>Generally, the FMV of a benefit is the price that could be reasonably charged for the use of that benefit in an open market (that is, the market price for a similar benefit in the surrounding area). Normally, the cost to the employer is not a factor in determining the value of the benefit. For example, where the employer owns the benefit provided, the value would be based on the FMV, not the employer's cost. </p>
<h3>When to re-evaluate the FMV</h3>
<p>Generally, you should re-evaluate the FMV of the benefit when there is a significant change to the market for that benefit in the area that may impact the FMV.</p>
<p>The CRA suggests you research the value of the benefit based on the following:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and cnjnctn-sm">
  <li class="cnjnctn-col">The rates charged to the public for a similar benefit in the same area as the benefit being provided to your employee</li>
  <li class="cnjnctn-col">The same conditions of use as the benefit being provided to your employee</li>
</ul>
<p>This determination must be done based on a review of the facts in each specific situation.</p>
