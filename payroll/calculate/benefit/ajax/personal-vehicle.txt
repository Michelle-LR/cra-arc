<p>Personal driving is <strong>any driving </strong>by an employee, or a person related to the employee, of a vehicle provided by the employer for purposes <strong>not </strong>related to their employment.  This includes driving between home to a regular place of employment. </p>

<p>If your employee <strong>does not</strong> use your vehicle for any personal driving, there is no taxable benefit, even if the vehicle is available to your employee for the entire year. This applies as long as the kilometres driven by your employee were in the <strong>course of their employment duties</strong> and the <strong>vehicle is returned to your premises at the end of their work day</strong>.</p>

<div id="ajax-regular">
<details><summary>What is a regular place of employment </summary>
<p>The CRA considers the <strong>regular place of employment </strong>any location where your employee <strong>regularly</strong>:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Reports for work </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Performs their employment duties </li>
</ul>
<p>"Regularly" means the degree of frequency or repetition in the employee's reporting to a work location in a period (weekly, monthly or yearly) . <strong>This does not need to be your establishment</strong>.  An employee can have multiple regular places of employment.</p>
<p>Generally, any travel by the employee between home and a regular place of employment is considered personal driving.</p>
<details><summary>Examples</summary>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul class="fa-ul">
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-lg fa-li text-success"></span> Office where your employee reports daily </li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-lg fa-li text-success"></span> Several store locations that a manager visits monthly </li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-lg fa-li text-success"></span> Client's premises when your employee reports daily for a 6 month project </li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-lg fa-li text-success"></span> Client's premises when your employee attends biweekly meetings </li>
</ul>
</details>
</details>

<details><summary>What if the employee drives to multiple work locations during the same day </summary>
<p>The CRA considers that if your employee drives to multiple work locations in a day, the following is considered <strong>personal driving</strong>:</p>
<ul class="fa-ul">
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-lg fa-li text-success"> Between the employee’s home and their first work location</span> </li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-lg fa-li text-success"></span> Between the final work location and the employee's home </li>
</ul>
 <p>Any travel by the employee between work locations is considered business driving.</p>
</details>
</div>

<div id="ajax-pointcall">
<details><summary>What is a point of call</summary>
<p>The CRA considers a point of call any location other than a regular place of employment where your employee goes to perform their employment duties. </p>
<p>Generally, any travel by the employee between home and a point of call is considered business driving, if at that time and on the way to or from work, it is reasonable. </p>
