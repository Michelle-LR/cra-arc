<details><summary>What is a <strong>regular place of employment</strong> </summary>
<p>The CRA considers a <strong>regular place of employment</strong> to be any location where your employee <strong>regularly</strong>:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Reports for work </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Performs their employment duties </li>
</ul>
<p>"Regularly" means there is some degree of frequency or repetition in your employee’s reporting to that particular work location in a period (weekly, monthly or yearly). <strong>This does not need to be your establishment</strong>.  An employee can have multiple regular places of employment.</p>
<p>Generally, any travel by your employee between home and a regular place of employment is considered personal driving.</p>
<details><summary>Examples of a regular place of employment</summary>
<p>A regular place of employment may include:</p>
<ul class="fa-ul">
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-lg fa-li text-success"></span> The office where your employee reports daily </li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-lg fa-li text-success"></span> Several store locations that a manager visits monthly </li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-lg fa-li text-success"></span> A client’s premises when your employee reports daily for a 6 month project </li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-lg fa-li text-success"></span> A client’s premises when your employee attends biweekly meetings </li>
</ul>
</details>
</details>

<details><summary>What if your employee drives to <strong>multiple regular place of employment during the same day</strong> </summary>
<p>Depending on the situation, your employee may have more than one location where they regularly report for work. The CRA considers that if your employee drives to multiple regular places of employment in a day, the following is considered <strong>personal driving</strong>:</p>
<ul class="fa-ul">
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-lg fa-li text-success"></span> Between your employee’s home and their first work location </li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-lg fa-li text-success"></span> Between the final work location and your employee’s home </li>
</ul>
 <p class="mrgn-tp-md">Any travel by your employee between regular places of employment is considered business driving.</p>
</details>
</div>

<div id="ajax-pointcall">
<details><summary>What is a <strong>point of call</strong></summary>
<p>The CRA considers a point of call any location other than a regular place of employment where your employee goes to perform their employment duties. </p>
<p>Generally, any travel by your employee between home and a point of call is considered business driving (not a taxable benefit), if you need or allow your employee to travel directly from home to a point of call, or return home from that point. In order to be considered business driving, it must be reasonable that your employee’s travel to the point to call be made at that time and on the way to or from work. </p>
<p>If the travel is not reasonable, it is considered personal driving and is a taxable benefit.</p>
