<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Seating capacity </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Type of vehicle </li>

</ul>
<p>As per the Income Tax Act:</p>
<ul>
<li>An <strong>automobile</strong> is defined as a motor vehicle that is designed or adapted mainly to carry individuals on highways and streets, and has a seating capacity of not more than the driver and eight passengers.</li>
<li>A <strong>motor vehicle</strong> is defined as an automotive vehicle designed or adapted to be used on highways and streets but does not include trolley buses or a vehicle designed or adapted for use exclusively on rails. The CRA treats motor vehicles and automobiles differently for income tax purposes, even though an automobile is a kind of motor vehicle.</li>
