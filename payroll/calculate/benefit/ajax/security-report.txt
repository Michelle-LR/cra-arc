<details><summary>Employee is eligible for the deduction under 110(1)(d) and employer can decide if they will deduct the cash-out </summary>
<p>The employer must decide if they will deduct the cash-out as an expense or if your employee will be allowed to claim the stock option deduction. </p>
<p>Either the employer <strong>or </strong>your employee can claim a deduction, <strong>not both</strong>. </p>
<p>If the employer chooses <strong>not </strong>to claim the cash-out as an expense, the employer must make an election to do so under subsection 110(1.1). This is done by entering the total amount of the security option cash-out that the employer elected not to claim as an expense using code <strong>86</strong>, "Security options election" in the "Other information" of the T4 slip. Your employee can claim the deduction on their T1 return (under paragraph 110(1)(d)).</p>
<p>The amount the employer reports under code <strong>86 </strong>may be different from the taxable benefit they have to include in your employee's income in box 14 and under code <strong>38</strong>.</p>
