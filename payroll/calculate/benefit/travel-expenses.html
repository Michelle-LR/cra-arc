<p>You must consider <strong>all of the facts </strong>relevant to your employee's situation to determine if the travel expense is considered <strong>reasonable</strong>.</p>
<p>This determination must be done based on a review of the facts in each specific situation.</p>
<p>Generally, the CRA considers the amount to be <strong>reasonable </strong>if:</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Employee is required to travel in the course of their employment duties (step 2) </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Your employee kept the required records, and you received a copy to support these amounts. For example, receipts for:
<ul  class="fa-ul">
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li fa-lg text-success"></span> Airfare</li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li fa-lg text-success"></span> Hotel</li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li fa-lg text-success"></span> Meal</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">You can justify your position for the amount being reasonable </li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">It is not a form of additional remuneration and is not a form of tax avoidance </li>
</ul>
<p>If you <strong>cannot </strong>get the required records, you must use reasonable estimates to determine the amount is based on facts.</p>
<p>Depending on your situation, you may determine that a reasonable amount would be lower or higher. </p>
<p>To confirm what the CRA would consider reasonable in your situation, you can ask for an advance income tax ruling that is binding on the CRA.</p>
