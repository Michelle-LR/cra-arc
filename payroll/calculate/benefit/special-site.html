 <div class="alert alert-info">
<p>Content has been updated for clarity, completeness and plain language. <strong>No changes were made to the current CRA administrative policy. </strong></p>
</div>
<p>You may provide a benefit for travel, board and loding expenses to your employee who works or lives in a location that is in a special work site.</p>
<p>Generally, a special work site is an area where temporary duties are performed by an employee who keeps a self-contained domestic establishment (SCDE) at another location as their principal place of residence. </p>
<p>Because of the distance between the two areas, the employee is not expected to return daily from the work site to his or her principal place of residence.</p>

<details><summary>Special work sites specific to fishers and seafarers</summary>
<p>A ship may qualify as a special work site or a remote work location when it is at sea for a period of 36 hours or more. Time at sea may include time spent on board because of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quarantine </li>
<li>Waiting for docking </li>
<li>Unloading cargo </li>
<li>Immigration or customs clearance </li>
</ul>
<p>The crew members of a fishing vessel, or any other type of vessel, who are paid a salary or wage (that is, they are employees rather than self-employed), may qualify for exemption from tax on the value of, or a reasonable allowance for, board and lodging received while on a ship, if the requirements of subsection 6(6) are met. The central concern regarding fishers is whether they are employees or self-employed. Questions on this determination should be referred to the CPP/EI Rulings Officer in the local tax services office. When the duties performed by an employee are of a temporary nature and the employee meets the conditions in subparagraph 6(6)(a)(i), a ship will qualify as a special work site at any time the employee is on board, whether it is in port or at sea. Where subsection 6(6) does not apply, the fair market value of rations and quarters supplied to the crew is included in their income and subject to deductions at source in the normal manner.)</p>
</details>

<p>It is possible for an employee to work at a location that is both a special work site and a remote work location. However, the benefit can only be excluded from the employee's income <strong>once</strong>.</p>

<p>Even if the distance is less than 80 kilometres, the CRA may still consider that it is not reasonable for the employee to make that trip after taking into account the following factors:</p>

<p>Under the CRA's administrative policy, if you paid an allowance or reimburse your employee, the benefit is <strong>not </strong>taxable if <strong>all </strong>of the following apply:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Your employee's duties require them to be away from their principal place of residence or to be at the special work site</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"> Duties performed by the employee at the special work site are temporary in nature</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Your employee keeps, at a location other than the special work site, a self-contained domestic establishment that, throughout the period, was available for the employee’s occupancy <strong>and</strong> was not rented to any other person</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"> Self-contained domestic establishment is far enough from the special work site that the employee could not reasonably be expected to return daily from the special work site</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col">Employee had to work at the special work site for a period of more than <strong>36 hours</strong>
<details><summary>Fishers and seafarers</summary>
<p>A ship may qualify as a special work site or a remote work location when it is at sea for a period of 36 hours or more. Time at sea may include time spent on board because of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Quarantine </li>
<li>Waiting for docking </li>
<li>Unloading cargo </li>
<li>Immigration or customs clearance </li>
</ul>
<p>The crew members of a fishing vessel, or any other type of vessel, who are paid a salary or wage (that is, they are employees rather than self-employed), may qualify for exemption from tax on the value of, or a reasonable allowance for, board and lodging received while on a ship, if the requirements of subsection 6(6) are met. The central concern regarding fishers is whether they are employees or self-employed. Questions on this determination should be referred to the CPP/EI Rulings Officer in the local tax services office. When the duties performed by an employee are of a temporary nature and the employee meets the conditions in subparagraph 6(6)(a)(i), a ship will qualify as a special work site at any time the employee is on board, whether it is in port or at sea. Where subsection 6(6) does not apply, the fair market value of rations and quarters supplied to the crew is included in their income and subject to deductions at source in the normal manner.)</p>

<li class="cnjnctn-col">Form <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/td4.html">TD4</a> is completed</li>
</ul>
<p>You can only exclude from income an allowance (not in excess of a reasonable amount) paid to your employee for board and lodging if they incurred the expense.</p>
<p>You and your employee must fill out Form TD4 Declaration of Exemption - Employment at a Special Work Site, to exclude board, lodging and transportation from your employee's income. You must keep a copy. The TD4 requires the exact location of the work site and the distance to your employee's principal place of residence.</p>

<h4>Taxable situation</h4>
<p>If the board and lodging expense you provide to your employee is:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and cnjnctn-sm">
