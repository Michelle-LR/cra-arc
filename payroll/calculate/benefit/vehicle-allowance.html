<div id="ajax-what-rate">
<p>Under the CRA's administrative policy, an allowance based on the per-kilometre rates prescribed in section 7306 of the Income Tax Regulations (maximum amount deductible as a business expense) is considered reasonable.</p>

<details><summary>Factors to consider to determine if using a <strong>lower or a higher</strong> per-kilometre rate is considered reasonable</summary>
 <div id="ajax-rates2">
<p>Depending on your situation and the factors, you may determine that a per-kilometre rate that is <strong>lower or higher</strong> than the prescribed rate is considered reasonable. For example, factors such as the type of vehicle, the driving conditions, or a higher fuel cost at a particular location, may be situations where you determine that the reasonable rates are higher or lower.</p> 
<p>To make sure you are using a rate that the CRA would consider reasonable in this situation, you can ask for an advance income tax ruling that is binding on the CRA. </p>
