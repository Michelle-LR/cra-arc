     <h2 id="h_1">What are CPP pensionable earnings</h2>
 <p>Pensionable earnings are the employee's remuneration from pensionable office or employment with certain exceptions.</p>

            <p>Generally, you must deduct CPP contributions from:</p>
             <ul class="fa-ul">
	      <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Salary, wages or other remuneration </li>
               <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Commissions </li>

               <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span> Certain tips and gratuities </li>
            </ul>
<p>To determine if you need to deduct CPP contributions, refer to:</p>

</ul>

 <h2 id="h_2">When to deduct CPP contributions</h2>
            <p>You have to deduct CPP contributions from your employee's pensionable earnings if the employee meets <strong>all </strong>of the following conditions:</p>
            <ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and">
  
 	<li class="cnjnctn-col">Employee is in pensionable employment during the year </li>
              <li class="cnjnctn-col">Employee is <strong>not </strong>considered to be disabled under the CPP or the Quebec Pension Plan (QPP) </li>
               <li class="cnjnctn-col"> Employee is between <strong>18 and 69</strong> years old, even if the employee is receiving a CPP or QPP retirement pension </li>
                        </ul>
            
 <p>If the employee is between <strong>65 and 69</strong> years old and gives you a completed <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/cpt30.html">Form CPT30 Election to Stop Contributing to the Canada Pension Plan, or Revocation of a Prior Election</a> during the year, you should stop deducting CPP contributions.</p>
 <p>Learn more: <a href="/cra-arc/payroll/calculate/payment/startstopcpp.html">Start, stop or restart CPP deductions</a></p>

 <h3>Employer CPP contributions</h3>      
<p>You <strong>must also contribute an amount equal</strong> to the CPP contributions that you deduct from your employees' remuneration and remit the total of both amounts. Even if the required deductions were not made, you are <strong>deemed </strong>to have made them and the deductions not being made may result in a PIER. </p>

 <h2 id="h_3">When to stop deducting CPP contributions</h2>
 <div id="ajax-stopcpp">
<p>For current employees, <strong>stop</strong> deducting CPP when the employee <strong>reaches the maximum contribution</strong> for the year in their <strong>employment with you</strong>.</p>
 
 <p>Learn more: <a href="/cra-arc/payroll/calculate/payment/startstopcpp.html">Start, stop or restart CPP deductions</a></p>

 <details><summary>Situations where you need to <strong>prorate the maximum CPP contribution</strong></summary>
           
            <p>You have to prorate the maximum CPP contribution in the following situations:</p>
        <div id="ajax-stopcppcond">
	 <ul>
               <li >Employee turns 18 in the year </li>
               <li >Employee turns 70 in the year </li>
              <li >Employee gives you a completed Form CPT30 during the year</li>
               <li >Employee is considered to be disabled under the CPP in the year</li>
               <li >Employee dies in the year </li>
            </ul>
 </div>
      
    </details>       
 </div>
 

           
<h2 id="h_4">What if the employee has different jobs</h2>
<p>The CPP annual maximum pensionable earnings apply to <strong>each job </strong>the employee holds with <strong>different employers </strong>(different business numbers). </p>

 <details><summary>What happens if your employee has <strong>multiple employers</strong></summary>

<p id="h_0_1">If an employee leaves one employer during the year to start work with another employer, the new employer also has to deduct CPP contributions without taking into account what the previous employer paid. This is the case even if the employee has contributed the maximum amount during the previous employment.</p>
<p>Any overpayments will be refunded to employees when they file their income tax and benefit returns. As an employer, you <strong>are not </strong>entitled to a refund for the employer's share of the contributions.</p>

<p>If you do not have a place of business in Canada, you have the option to file for CPP coverage for your employees in Canada (resident or non-resident) by filling out <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/cpt13.html">Form CPT13, Application for an Employer Resident Outside Canada to Cover Employment in Canada Under the Canada Pension Plan</a>.</p>

<details><summary>What to do if the employee may be subject to a <strong>foreign social security plan</strong></summary>
<p>Canada has reciprocal social security agreements with certain other countries to ensure that only one plan covers an employee, either the CPP or a foreign social security plan. To find out if a particular country has an agreement with Canada and which CPT application form to use, see <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/canada-pension-plan-cpp-employment-insurance-ei-rulings/international-social-security-agreements-canada-pension-plan/what-purpose-international-social-security-agreements.html">What is the purpose of international social security agreements?</a></p>

<h3>First Nations workers who are self-employed</h3>
<p>If you are a self-employed <a href="#fnterm" aria-controls="fnterm" class="overlay-lnk" role="button">First Nations worker <span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a>, , you can elect to pay CPP on your tax-exempt self-employment income by filing out <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/cpt20.html">Form CPT20, Election to Pay Canada Pension Plan Contributions</a> when filing your personal income tax return.</p>
   
<h2 id="h_10">What is the CPP enhancement</h2>
<p>Before January 1, 2019, employees were making a contribution of 4.95% on their pensionable earnings up to their annual maximum pensionable earnings (first ceiling), with employers making an equal contribution. These are the <strong>base contributions </strong>to the CPP. </p>
<p>From 2019 to 2023, the contribution rate for employees was increased gradually from 4.95% to 5.95%. These are the base contributions (4.95%) and the <strong>first additional contribution</strong> to the CPP (1%).</p>
<p>Beginning in 2024, an additional maximum pensionable earnings (second higher ceiling) is introduced. A <strong>second additional CPP contribution (CPP2)</strong> is made on these earnings, beginning at the first earnings ceiling and going up to the second earnings ceiling. </p>
