Grocery Rebate</h1>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <p>As announced in Budget 2023, the Government of Canada introduced a Grocery Rebate to provide financial support to eligible Canadians.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info">
	<p><strong>One-time benefit</strong></p>
	<p>The Grocery Rebate was a <strong>one-time benefit</strong> that was:
		<ul>
			<li>issued on July 5, 2023</li>
			<li>based on an individual's 2021 tax return information</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) will <strong>not</strong> be administering a similar Grocery Rebate in 2024.</p>
	</div>

	
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h2>Who received the one-time payment</h2>
<p>You would have received the one-time Grocery Rebate if you were entitled to receive the GST/HST credit for&nbsp;<strong><span class="nowrap">January 2023</span></strong>.</p>
<p>To receive the Grocery Rebate, you had to file a tax return for 2021, even if you had no income to report for that year.</p>

    




	<p>It is possible you may have been entitled to the Grocery Rebate, but not the July GST/HST credit or vice versa. The Grocery Rebate was calculated based on your 2021 tax return, but the next quarterly GST/HST credit payment in July 2023 was calculated based on your 2022 tax return. Please check your Notice of (Re)determination for more information.</p>


	

</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h2>Eligibility criteria</h2>
<p>You and your spouse or common-law partner (if applicable) must have met the&nbsp;<a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/rc4210/gst-hst-credit.html#toc4">eligibility criteria</a>&nbsp;for the 2021 base year to qualify for this rebate.</p>

    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h2>Payment details</h2>
<p>The one-time Grocery Rebate would have been double the amount of your GST/HST credit payment from <span class="nowrap">January 2023</span>.&nbsp; The amount was calculated based on&nbsp;<strong>your family situation in <span class="nowrap">January 2023</span></strong>&nbsp;and your 2021 adjusted family net income.</p>
<p><strong>You could have received a maximum one-time payment of up to:</strong></p>
<p>If you are single</p>
<ul>
<li>$234 (no children)</li>
<li>$387 (with 1 child)</li>
<li>$467 (with 2 children)</li>
<li>$548 (with 3 children)</li>
<li>$628 (with 4 children)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are married or have a common-law partner</p>
<ul>
<li>$306 (no children)</li>
<li>$387 (with 1 child)</li>
<li>$467 (with 2 children)</li>
<li>$548 (with 3 children)</li>
<li>$628 (with 4 children)</li>

<p>If you received your GST/HST credit payment as a lump sum in <span class="nowrap">July 2022</span>, you still would have benefitted from the one-time Grocery Rebate.</p>
<p>Tax refunds, benefit and credit payments may have been applied to pay outstanding balances. You can check the status of your benefits by logging into your CRA <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-individuals/account-individuals.html">My Account</a>.

        <h2>Payment Date</h2>
<p>The one-time Grocery Rebate was issued on <span class="nowrap">July 5, 2023</span>.</p>
