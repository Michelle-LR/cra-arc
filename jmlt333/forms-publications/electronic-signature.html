         <h1 property="name" id="wb-cont">Using electronic signatures</h1>

<p>An electronic signature is an efficient way to provide consent and declare information given on forms exchanged between third parties is correct and complete.</p>
	      <p>Whether a signature is paper-based or electronic, the purpose is to link a person to a document (or transaction), and typically provides evidence of that person’s intent to approve or to be bound by its contents. </p>
	      

	      
<p>The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) allows taxpayers and third parties to use an electronic signature on the following forms:</p>
	      <ul>
		      <li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t183.html">T183, Information Return for Electronic Filing of an Individual’s Income Tax and Benefit Return</a></li>
		      <li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t183corp.html">T183CORP, Information Return for Corporations Filing Electronically</a></li>
		      <li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t183trust.html">T183TRUST, Information Return for the Electronic Filing of a Trust Return</a></li>
		      <li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t2200.html">T2200, Declaration of Conditions of Employment</a></li>
		      <li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t1223.html">T1223, Clergy Residence Deduction</a></li>
	      </ul>
<p>It is the taxpayer's choice whether they would like to sign these forms traditionally or apply an electronic signature.</p>

	<p>Available February 2024:</p>
	      <ul>
		         <li>RC71, Statement of Discounting Transaction</li>
		         <li>RC72, Notice of the Actual Amount of the Refund of Tax</li>
		      
	      </ul>


	      <h2>Applying electronic signatures to forms</h2>
<p>In order for the CRA to accept the use of electronic signatures between third parties on these forms, it is expected that identity verification has been performed by the party <strong>receiving</strong> the signed form.</p> 
	      <p>The electronic signature that is incorporated in, attached to, or associated with the form must meet conditions depending on how it is applied.</p>
	      
	      
	      <p>If an electronic signature is applied to a form <strong>in person</strong> by the individual, it <strong>must</strong> be applied in the presence of the other party using a method such as writing with a stylus or a finger on a tablet.</p>	  
	  <p>If an electronic signature is <strong>not</strong> applied to a form <strong>in person</strong> by an individual, it <strong>must</strong> be applied to the form that is then sent to the other party by either:</p>    

	      <ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-xs">
  <li class="cnjnctn-col">
   

    <p>Using the electronic address most recently provided to the other party for that purpose</p>
  </li>
  <li class="cnjnctn-col">


    <p>Through an access controlled, secured, electronic location, such as a secure website, that is accessible to the individual only because the other party has made that location known, and granted access to the individual</p>
	 
	   </li>
</ul>  


	      
<h3>Masking social insurance numbers (SIN)</h3>
<p>To ensure the security of personal information, the CRA highly recommends that the first 5 digits of a SIN be masked on forms. The CRA follows this practice when generating or displaying notices and statements that contain a SIN.</p>
        
	   <h2>Electronic signatures in certified tax software</h2>   
	      
	      <p>EFILE certified software may include electronic signature solutions developed in-house or they may contain third party solutions. Electronic filers can also offer signature solutions of their choice that operate or function independently of EFILE software. </p>
	      <p>Certain forms may include a date-and-time stamp:</p>
	      <ul>
		      <li>Year/month/day</li>
		       <li>HH/MM/SS (hour/minute/second)</li>
	      </ul>
	 <p>If an electronic signature has been applied to a form, the CRA will accept a date-and-time stamp that was automatically populated by software or manually entered by a taxpayer or electronic filer. </p>     
	  <p>Each electronic signature solution has its own default settings for displaying date and time. Electronic filers may need to adjust the document formatting settings in their electronic signature service account to make sure that the date and time are displayed on an electronically signed form. Such adjustments to document formatting settings may be needed whether or not an electronic signature solution is integrated into the filer’s software.</p>    

	      <h3>Certificate of completion</h3>
	      <p>In addition to the electronically signed forms, the electronic signature solution may provide a certificate of completion. Electronic filers must keep the certificate and the electronically signed forms in case the CRA asks for them as part of its monitoring work.</p>
	      <p>Keeping a certificate of completion will be especially important if an electronically signed copy of a form does not display the timestamp of an electronic signature.</p>
