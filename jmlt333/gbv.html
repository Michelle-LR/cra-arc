      <p>The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) understands the importance of getting benefit and credit payments, especially during times of stress and transition.</p>

    <p>If you are facing an abusive or violet situation, including economic abuse, we are commited to helping you continue to get support.</p>

<p>You will <strong>never</strong> need to contact an abusive person or organization to provide any information to the CRA, use your My Account, or apply for and get your benefits.</p>

	      </ul>


	      
        <h2 id="updating">Updating your personal information</h2>

<p>To get your benefit and credit payments on time, in the correct amounts, your personal information needs to be up-to-date.</p>
	      <p>It is important to protect your personal and financial information. Regularly update your passwords to ensure your accounts stay secure.</p>
    



<ol class="lst-stps ld-zr">
		<li>
			<h3>Cancel or authorize a representative</h3>
	
		<p>Review who can access your CRA account and remove anyone who should not have access.</p>
			<p>If someone assisted you with your taxes in the past, they may have been granted authorization to access your account.</p>
			<p>Removing a representative online or by phone will <strong>immediately</strong> cancel their access to your account.</p>
			<p>You can also authorize a trusted person, such as a friend or family member, to be a representative.</p>
			<h4>You can cancel or add a representative’s authorization:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="#myaccount">Online using your CRA My Account</a></li>
				<li><a href="#contact">By phone or mail</a></li>
			</ul>

		<li>


			
			<h3>Update personal information</h3>

		
			<p>The CRA may need to contact other individuals or organizations to verify details such as your marital status or child custody information. </p>
			<p>Your personal information will <strong>never</strong> be disclosed to anyone who is not authorized on your account. </p>

<details>
	<summary>Your address</summary>
	<p>If you move, update your address to keep receiving:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>your payments</li>
		<li>mail from the CRA</li>
	</ul>
	
	<br>
	<p>Even if you use direct deposit and your bank account does not change, it’s important to update your address.</p>
<p>You can give the CRA any temporary address until you have a permanent address available. This could include a:</p>
<ul>
	<li>friend's house</li>
	<li>shelter</li>
	<li>temporary safe place</li>
</ul>

<br>
	
		<p>If you were using a joint email account, you may need to open a new account in your name.</p>
	<p>You should do this:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>to maximize safety</li>
		<li>if you choose to register for the CRA My Account</li>
		
	</ul>
	
	
	
</details>

<details>
	<summary>Your marital status</summary>
	<p>If you separate from your spouse or common-law partner, you must wait <strong>90 days</strong> before letting the CRA know.</p>
	<p>We will then recalculate your benefits based on your new marital status and adjusted family net income. The adjustment will take effect the month after your marital status changed. </p>

</details>

<details>
	<summary>Your custody information</summary>
			<p>If your child and custody situation changes, let the CRA know as soon as possible.</p>
			<p>To make sure you get your benefit and credit payments on time and in the correct amounts, the CRA needs to know if:</p>
<ul>
	<li>a child starts to live with you </li>
	<li>a child is no longer in your care </li>
	<li>a shared custody arrangement has changed </li>
</ul>
<br>
		
<p>If you are the primary caregiver for a child or children in your home but are not receiving the Canada child benefit (CCB), consider applying now. </p>

</details>
<details>
	<summary>Your direct deposit information</summary>
	<p>For direct deposit payments, make sure we have the correct financial account information on file.</p>
	<p>If you were using a joint account, you may need to open a new account in your name. It’s important to provide this new account information to the CRA as soon as possible.</p>
	<p><strong>Do not</strong> close your old account until your first payment has been deposited to your new account.</p>
	<p>If your benefit payments were deposited into a financial account under another person's name that you can no longer access, please inform the CRA. It may be possible to have the payment reissued to a new account or by cheque.</p>
	<p>Update your direct deposit information at least 4 weeks before your next benefit payment is issued to make sure it is deposited into your new account on time.</p>

	<p>A social insurance number (SIN) is a 9-digit number that is personal, confidential and unique to you. You need a SIN to work in Canada and to receive benefits and services from government programs. </p>

<p>Your SIN is private and it’s illegal for anyone else to use it. </p>
	
<p>Find out how you can protect your SIN.</p>
	
<p>If you do not have a SIN, or if you don’t know your SIN or have access to it, please contact Service Canada at 1-866-274-6627 or visit a Service Canada office to apply for or retrieve your SIN information.</p>
	
<p>If Service Canada is unable to give you a permanent or temporary SIN, the CRA may give you a temporary tax number (TTN), which can be used to get benefit and credit payments, file your taxes and sign up for the CRA's online services.</p>

<h3>File your tax return every year</h3>
	      <p>You don’t have to apply for benefits like the CCB every year, but the CRA uses information from your tax return to calculate the amount of money you receive. That’s why it’s important to do your taxes every year, even if you have no income or if your income is tax-exempt. You have until April 30 to do your taxes each year. This will help make sure you keep getting your benefit and credit payments.</p>

<h3>Apply for child benefits</h3>
<p>If you care for a child under 18 and do not currently receive child benefits for them, consider applying now for the Canada child benefit (CCB). You can apply through your digital account with CRA called  My Account or by filling out Form RC66, Canada Child Benefits Application.</p>
	      <p>Your spouse or common-law partner’s signature is not required on Form RC66 or any other benefit-related form.</p>
	      <p>Check for other benefits and credits that might apply to you: Tax-related benefits, credits, deductions and support</p>

	      <h3>Keep getting your payments</h3>

<p>If you notice a change in your benefit or credit payments, find out why your payments may have changed or stopped. For example, if your spouse or common-law partner has not filed their taxes, your payments may be stopped.</p>
<p>If you have questions, or your benefit and credit payments have stopped, the CRA can help. </p>
<p>You can contact the CRA by: </p>

        <h2 id="what">What to do when the CRA contacts you</h2>
<p>You may get a letter from the CRA asking you to confirm your personal information or provide supporting documentation. </p>
	      <p>You can work with a trusted friend or organization to help you respond. Please send any supporting information back to the address listed on the letter or through My Account.</p>
	      <p>If your situation prevents you from getting the requested documents or information, you can send any of the following to explain your situation:</p>
	      <ul>
		      <li>a letter from a trusted third party representative explaining your situation, for example:</li>
	     <ul><li>a band council</li></ul>
		       <ul><li>a shelter</li></ul>
		       <ul><li>a resettlement office</li></ul>
		       <ul><li>a member of the clergy</li></ul>
	      <li>a copy of a restraining order or an order of protection</li>
		      <li>a copy of a police report</li>
	    
	      
	      
	      </ul>

      <p>If you have questions about the documents requested, or about your benefit and credit payments, please call 1-800-387-1193. The CRA will work with you to accommodate your or your family's needs.</p>
