        <p>Only certain individuals can view tax information about a business. The CRA requires information on each owner, partner or director. 
		The CRA generally only shares tax information about a corporation through:</p>
<ul>
<li>MyBusiness Account</li>
<li>Represent a client</li>
<li>Mail</li>
<li>Telephone</li>
</ul>

<p>The following individuals can request tax information:</p>

<ul>
<li>director(s)of a corporation</li>
<li>delegated authority (<a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/representative-authorization/access/levels-scope.html">level 3</a>)</li>
<li>third-party representatives authorized by a director or a delegated authority</li>
<li>legal representatives for the corporation (eg. bankruptcy trustee, court-appointed custodian)</li>
</ul>

<p>To avoid any delays or issues, we must have up-to-date information on directors.</p>

<p>If a new corporation is created, or the structure or directors of an existing corporation changes, you need to inform the CRA by taking the following steps:</p>

<h3>(1)Register with the federal or provincial authority</h3>    
<p>Register and keep your corporation information up to date with the federal or provincial authority. For a new or successor corporation, the information you provide must include:</p>

<ul>
<li>effective date of incorporation</li>
<li>address of corporation</li>
<li>names of directors</li>
</ul>

</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h4>Incorporating bodies that automatically share information with the CRA</h4>
<p>If you register with one of the following authorities, they will <strong>automatically share</strong> the information you give  them with the CRA:</p>

<ul>
<li>Alberta</li>
<li>British Columbia</li>
<li>Corporations Canada</li>
<li>Manitoba</li>
<li>New Brunswick</li>
<li>Nova Scotia</li>
<li>Ontario</li>
<li>Prince Edward Island</li>
<li>Saskatchewan</li>
</ul>    

<p><strong>For a territory or a province not listed above, contact the CRA(see Step 2)</strong>.</p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h3>(2)Provide documentation to the CRA, if applicable</h3>
<p>Send official documentation regarding your corporation and director information to the CRA using one of the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>the submit document service in <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-businesses/business-account.html">My Business Account</a> or <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/represent-a-client.html">Represent a Client</a></li>

                <section class="alert alert-info"><p><strong>You must provide a director’s SIN to access My Business Account</strong></p>
				<p>This step is necessary for a director to access <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-businesses/business-account.html">My Business Account</a> and authorize a delegated authority or other third-party representative for online access to the business tax account using <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/represent-a-client.html">Represent a Client</a>. If you have already provided a director’s social insurance number (SIN) as part of registration documentation, we’ll update the CRA’s records.</p></section>

</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">

<p>If you did not previously provide a director’s SIN,you can provide it in one of the following ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>a representative may use the submit document service in <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/represent-a-client.html">Represent a Client</a> to send a request signed by the director</li>
<li>a director can call  Business Enquiries at 1-800-959-5525</li>
<li>a director (or a representative) can fax a request signed by the director to their tax centre (PEI TC, 1-833-724-7237 or Sudbury TC 1-855-276-1529)</li>
<li>a director (or a representative) can mail a request signed by the director to their tax centre</li>
</ul> 

<p>For tax centre addresses, please visit <a href="/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information/tax-services-offices-tax-centres.html?utm_campaign=not-applicable&utm_medium=vanity-url&utm_source=canada-ca_tax-centres">Find a CRA address</a>.</p>
    
	<h2 id="#Non-resident directors">Non-resident directors of Canadian corporations</h2>
	
<p>Non-resident directors need to take the extra step of informing the CRA of their non-residency status. Incorporating authorities do not normally provide it as part of the information they send to the CRA.</p>
<p>One director can attest the non-residency status of all of the directors. Any directors that cannot be confirmed by this director will need to attest to their own non-residency status.</p>
<p>You can provide us with a director’s name, non-residency status, address, and phone number in one of the following ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>a director can call Business Enquiries at 1-800-959-5525</li>
<li>a director (or a representative) can fax a request signed by the director to their tax centre (PEI TC, 1-833-724-7237 or Sudbury TC, 1-855-276-1529)a director (or a representative) can mail a request signed by the director to their tax centre (<a href="/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information/tax-services-offices-tax-centres.html?utm_campaign=not-applicable&utm_medium=vanity-url&utm_source=canada-ca_tax-centres">Find a CRA address</a>)</li>
</ul>

        <h2 id="#Authorize a third-party">Authorizing a delegated authority or other third-party representative</h2>
		
		<p>Once a corporation provides a director’s SIN, that director will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>access <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-businesses/business-account.html">My Business Account</a></li>
<li>authorize a third-party to handle tax matters for  the director</li>
</ul>

<p>For more information, please visit:</p> 

<ul>
<li><a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/representative-authorization.html">Representative authorization</a></li>
<li><a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/representative-authorization/access/levels-scope.html">Levels and scope of authorization that you can give representatives of your business</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The quickest way a director can authorize a representative is by entering their representative’s RepID, GroupID, or BN in  the “Manage authorized representatives” section in <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-businesses/business-account.html">My Business Account</a>.</p>
<p>Third-party representatives can also ask for authorization on behalf of directors through the:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/represent-a-client.html">Represent a Client</a> portal</li>
<li>Business Consent Service in their certified tax software</li>
</ul>

<p>However, a director will still need to confirm these authorization requests in <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-businesses/business-account.html">My Business Account</a>. For more information on this two-step verification process, please visit <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/representative-authorization/confirm-representative.html">Confirm my representative’s authorization request</a>.</p>

</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">

<p>Those corporations that are part of the CRA’s large business population may be able to reach out to a CRA large business audit case manager with whom they have an ongoing relationship to obtain guidance or support in relation to the Confirm my Representative process.</p>

                <p>Non-residents do not have the same access to the CRA’s online portals due to security and authentication requirements. If all of a corporation’s directors are confirmed to be non-resident in the CRA’s records, the CRA will try to verify an authorization request by phone.</p></section>

<h3>Updating a Sole proprietorship</h3>
<p>A sole proprietorship is legally and directly tied to one specific individual. If you sell or stop operating your business, you <strong>must</strong> close your business number (BN) and all your CRA program accounts by calling us at <strong>1-800-959-5525</strong>.</p>
<p>A new owner can't continue using the old BN. They will have to get a new BN and new program accounts for the business. For more information, go to <a href="/en/services/taxes/business-number.html">Business number</a>.</p>

</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">

<h3>Updating a Partnership</h3>
<p>If the structure of your partnership changes and a partner leaves or one is added, call us at <strong>1-800-959-5525</strong>.</p>
<p>A change of partners will have a different impact on your business depending on your partnership agreement. The legal name of the business may need to change depending on how it was registered:<p>

<ul>
<li>If the business uses a provincially registered operating name, it may not need to change</li>
<li>If it was registered using the legal names of each partner, it may need to change</li>
</ul>

<p>In some cases, if the partners change, the business is considered a new legal entity and requires a new business number as well as new CRA program accounts.</p>
