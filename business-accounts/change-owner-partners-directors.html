        <p>Depending on your business, a change of owners, partners or directors may require different actions, such as changing legal names or registering a new business number and new program accounts.</p>
<p>This page covers general situations. You will find information on the following:</p>

        <h2 id="update_info">Update your information</h2>
<p>It is very important to keep your business information complete, accurate and up to date with the Canada Revenue <span class="nowrap">Agency (CRA)</span>. Otherwise, you might not get important reminders or information. In some cases you might not get your refunds, rebates, or other disbursements. For more information on how to update your information, go to <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/changes-your-business.html">Changes to your business and Canada Revenue Agency program accounts</a>.</p>

    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h2 id="sole_proprietorship">Sole proprietorship</h2>
<p>A sole proprietorship is legally and directly tied to one specific individual. If you sell or stop operating your business, you <strong>must</strong> close your business <span class="nowrap">number (BN)</span> and all your&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>&nbsp;program accounts&nbsp;by calling us <span class="nowrap">at <strong>1-800-959-5525</strong>.</span></p>
<p>A new owner can't continue using the old <abbr title="business number">BN</abbr>. They will have to get a new <abbr title="business number">BN</abbr> and new program accounts for the business.&nbsp;For more information, go to <a href="/en/services/taxes/business-number.html">Business number</a>.</p>
<p>If you are a sole proprietor who is a <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> of Canada or you have a <span class="nowrap">social insurance number</span> beginning <span class="nowrap">with a 9 or a 0,</span> go to <a href="/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information/non-resident-gst-hst-enquiries.html">Non-resident GST/HST Enquiries</a>.</p>

    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h2 id="partnership">Partnership</h2>
<p>If the structure of your partnership changes and a partner leaves or one is added, call us at <span class="nowrap"><strong>1-800-959-5525</strong></span>.</p>
<p>For non-resident partnership changes, go to <a href="/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information/non-resident-gst-hst-enquiries.html">Non-resident GST/HST Enquiries</a>.</p>
<p>A change of partners will have a different impact on your business depending on your partnership agreement. The legal name of the business may need to change depending on how it was registered:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the business uses a provincially registered operating name, it may not need to change</li>
<li>If it was registered using the legal names of each partner, it may need to change</li>
</ul>
<p>In some cases, if the partners change, the business is considered a new legal entity and requires a new business number as well as new <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> program accounts.</p>

    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h2 id="corporation">Corporation</h2>
<p>Before you call the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>, any structure or owner changes for a corporation must be updated and validated with the federal or provincial incorporating authorities. The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> can't control how long it takes for an incorporating authority to update their registry.</p>
<p>Once the changes to your corporation are visible on the corporate registry, call us at <strong><span class="nowrap">1-800-959-5525</span></strong>.</p>
<p>If your business is incorporated or formed outside of Canada, go to <a href="/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information/non-resident-gst-hst-enquiries.html">Non-resident GST/HST Enquiries</a>.</p>
<p>It is important to make sure that the incorporating authority's registry and the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> have the correct directors' names on file. In certain circumstances, there may be legal implications for outgoing and incoming directors. We recommend that you get familiar with the corporate laws in the jurisdiction in which you are incorporated. For more information on a shareholder's limited liability, go to <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed-income/setting-your-business/corporation.html#tocbullet3">Assessing your responsibility for corporation's debts</a>.</p>
<p>For more information on director's liability, see <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/ic89-2.html">Information <span class="nowrap">Circular IC89-2</span>, Directors' Liability</a>.</p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h2 id="yoursin_yoursecurity">Your social insurance number; your security</h2>
<p>Regardless of the business structure, operation type or program, we ask to have the name and social insurance <span class="nowrap">number (SIN) </span>of one or more owners, directors or partners on file. Ideally, any individual in control of the business and who has certifying authority should provide their <abbr title="social insurance number">SIN</abbr>. This is because we can only give information to the specific individuals listed for a business number. We can't accept changes to the information related to a business number without the consent of these individuals. We also can't add representatives without the individuals' authority and consent.</p>
<p>A <abbr title="social insurance number">SIN</abbr> provides greater security than a name alone because it identifies specific individuals with certainty and accuracy. It ensures we only talk to the rightful owners, partners or directors of a business. It also ensures that only the right individuals can create delegated authorities or authorize representatives. In fact, the <abbr title="social insurance number">SIN</abbr> is necessary to access <strong><span class="nowrap">My Business Account</span></strong>.</p>
<p>Using both <abbr title="social insurance number">SIN</abbr> and name prevents confusion when exchanging information with individuals with the same or similar names. The <abbr title="social insurance number">SIN</abbr> is also used in the prevention and detection of identity theft and wrongful disclosure. Providing your <abbr title="social insurance number">SIN</abbr> allows both you and the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> to take more immediate actions if an unauthorized activity is detected. Having your <abbr title="social insurance number">SIN</abbr> listed for the business number also improves your ability to exercise your rights as stated in the Privacy Act and the Access to Information Act.</p>

        <h2 id="other_considerations">Other considerations</h2>
<p>In addition to the situations already covered, some changes may need further actions, have tax implications or have program specific requirements. We recommend that you review the rules for your business number's program accounts. For example, your payroll deductions accounts may need special attention when your business is undergoing changes. For more information, go to <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/t4001/employers-guide-payroll-deductions-remittances.html#P326_25447">Changes to your business entity</a> in <span class="nowrap">Guide T4001</span>, Employers' <span class="nowrap">Guide –</span> Payroll Deductions and Remittances.</p>
