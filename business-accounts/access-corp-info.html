		<h2 id="what">What the CRA needs to update corporate information</h2>
		<p>Info</p> 

		
<p>The Canadian Revenue Agency requires, for all types of businesses, the names and social insurance numbers (SIN) of:</p>
<ul>
	<li>owners</li>
	<li>directors, or</li>
	<li>partners</li>
</ul>
<p>Only authorized individuals listed for a business number can access or make changes to the information. Consent is necessary for any modifications or additions of representatives. 
</p>	 
<p>The CRA generally only shares tax information about a corporation through:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>My Business Account</li>
	<li>Represent a client</li>
	<li>Mail</li>
	<li>Telephone</li>
</ul>

<p>
The following individuals can request tax information:

<ul>
<li>director(s) of a corporation</li>
<li>D0ated authority (level 3</li>
<li>third-party representatives authorized by a director or a delegated authority</li>
<li>legal representatives for the corporation (eg. bankruptcy trustee, court-appointed custodian)</li>

</ul>
•	
To avoid any delays or issues,  we must have up-to-date information on directors.


<h2 id="add">
	Add or update corporation and director information
</h2>

If a new corporation is created, or the structure or directors of an existing corporation changes, you need to inform the CRA by taking the following steps:


<h3>Register with the federal or provincial authority 
</h3>

Register and keep your corporation information up to date with the federal or provincial authority. For a new or successor corporation, the information you provide must include:
•	effective date of incorporation
•	address of corporation
•	names of directors

Incorporating bodies that automatically share information with the CRA [H4]
If you register with one of the following authorities, they will automatically share the information you give  them with the CRA:
•	Alberta
•	British Columbia
•	Corporations Canada
•	Manitoba
•	New Brunswick
•	Nova Scotia
•	Ontario
•	Prince Edward Island
•	Saskatchewan

For a territory or a province not listed above, contact the CRA(see Step 2).
  Provide documentation to the CRA, if applicable [H3]

Send official documentation regarding your corporation and director information to the CRA using one of the following ways:
•	the submit document service in My Business Account or Represent a Client 
•	mail – visit Find a CRA address 


<h3>Provide director SIN to the CRA</h3>

You must provide a director’s SIN to access My Business Account
This step is necessary for a director to access My Business Account and authorize a delegated authority or other third-party representative for online access to the business tax account using Represent a Client. If you have already provided a director’s social insurance number (SIN) as part of registration documentation, we’ll update the CRA’s records.

If you did not previously provide a director’s SIN,you can provide it in one of the following ways::
•	a representative may use the submit document service in Represent a Client  to send a request signed by the director 
•	a director can call  Business Enquiries at 1-800-959-5525
•	a director (or a representative) can fax a request signed by the director to their tax centre (PEI TC, 1-833-724-7237 or Sudbury TC 1-855-276-1529)
•	a director (or a representative) can mail a request signed by the director to their tax centre

For tax centre addresses, please visit Find a CRA address.

<h3>Non-resident directors of Canadian corporations
</h3>

Non-resident directors need to take the extra step of informing the CRA of their non-residency status. Incorporating authorities do not normally provide it as part of the information they send to the CRA. 
One director can attest the non-residency status of all of the directors. Any directors that cannot be confirmed by this director will need to attest to their own non-residency status.
You can provide us with a director’s name, non-residency status, address, and phone number in one of the following ways:
•	a director can call Business Enquiries at 1-800-959-5525
•	a director (or a representative) can fax a request signed by the director to their tax centre (PEI TC, 1-833-724-7237 or Sudbury TC, 1-855-276-1529)a director (or a representative) can mail a request signed by the director to their tax centre (Find a CRA address)
•	
•	Non-residents access to CRA’s portals
•	Non-residents do not have the same access to the CRA’s online portals due to security and authentication requirements. If all of a corporation’s directors are confirmed to be non-resident in the CRA’s records, the CRA will try to verify an authorization request by phone.


Authorizing a delegated authority or other third-party representative [H3]


Once a corporation provides a director’s SIN, that director will be able to:
•	access My Business Account
•	authorize a third-party to handle tax matters for  the director
For more information, please visit:
•	Representative authorization  
•	Levels and scope of authorization that you can give representatives of your business
The quickest way a director can authorize a representative is by entering their representative’s RepID, GroupID, or BN in  the “Manage authorized representatives” section in My Business Account. 
Third-party representatives can also ask for authorization on behalf of directors through the:
•	Represent a Client portal 
•	Business Consent Service in their certified tax software
However, a director will still need to confirm these authorization requests in My Business Account. For more information on this two-step verification process, please visit Confirm my representative’s authorization request.

Those corporations that are part of the CRA’s large business population may be able to reach out to a CRA large business audit case manager with whom they have an ongoing relationship to obtain guidance or support in relation to the Confirm my Representative process.
