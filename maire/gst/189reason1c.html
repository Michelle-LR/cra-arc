<h1 property="name" id="wb-cont" class="gc-thickline">General GST/HST rebate - Reason code 1C</h1>

<p>General GST/HST rebates are claimed under one of several reason codes by filling out Form GST189, General Application for GST/HST Rebate. You can only use one reason code per rebate application. If you are eligible to claim a rebate under more than one code, use a separate rebate application for each reason code.</p>


 <h2 class="h3">On this page</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="#h-1">Who is eligible</a></li>
	       <li><a href="#h-2">Calculate the rebate</a> </li>
               <li><a href="#h-3">How to file</a></li>
                              <li><a href="#h-4">When to file</a></li>

            </ul>

  <h2 id="h-1">Who is eligible</h2>
		 <p>You can apply for a rebate of an amount if <strong>one</strong> of these situations applies:</p>
		 <ul><li>You paid or remitted it as or on account of GST/HST or net tax that you should <strong>not</strong> have paid or remitted, or that was more than you had to pay or remit</li>
		 <li>You paid it as penalty, interest, or any other similar obligation that was <strong>not</strong> payable or remittable</li>
		 </ul>
		<details>
			<summary>Exeption: Amount collected in error</summary>
			<p>If you collected an amount as or on account of GST/HST that you should not have collected, you have to include that amount in the calculation of your net tax. You are not entitled to claim a rebate for amounts you collected as GST/HST in error.</p>
		<p>To correct this error, refund or credit the amount to your customer and issue your customer a credit note for the amount. You can then reduce your net tax owing by the amount you refunded or credited to your customer. Include the amount of the adjustment on line 107 of your GST/HST return in the reporting period in which you issued the credit note.</p>
		</details> 

		 <details>
<summary>Exeption: Amount paid in error</summary>
		<p>If you believe you paid an amount as GST/HST in error to a supplier, you can request a refund or credit of the amount from the supplier, instead of applying for a rebate under reason code 1C. This is often the simplest way for you to recover the amount. If the supplier gives you a refund or credit, you are no longer eligible for a rebate because the amount you paid in error has already been refunded or credited to you. If you cannot get a refund or credit from the supplier (for example, if the supplier refuses to refund the amount or goes out of business), you can apply for a rebate of that amount under reason code 1C.</p>	 
		<p>You are not entitled to a rebate for amounts paid or remitted in error if any of the following apply:</p>
			 <ul>
				 <li>The amount has been taken into account as tax or net tax in an assessment</li>
				 <li>The amount paid was tax, net tax, penalty, interest, or any other amount assessed</li>
				 <li>The amount is the result of an appraisal or reappraisal of the value of goods, or a determination that the GST/HST applies to the goods by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)</li>
				 <li>You are a GST/HST registrant and the amount paid in error resulted from an incorrectly filled-out GST/HST return which has been or will be corrected</li>
			 </ul>
		 <p>If the CBSA appraises or reappraises the value of goods, the result may be that you paid GST/HST in error, or more than what you actually owed. In this case, you have to apply to the CBSA for a refund of the amount.</p>
		 </details>

		 <details>
			 <summary>Exception: Rebate of GST/HST paid for goods imported</summary>
			 <p>If you import goods on a consignment, approval, or sale-or-return basis and export them within 60 days without having used or consumed them in Canada, except on a trial basis, you can apply to the CBSA for a rebate of the GST/HST you paid on these goods when you imported them. Similarly, if goods you import to consume or use are of inferior quality, damaged, or defective, you may be entitled to a rebate through the CBSA of the GST/HST you paid when you imported them.</p>
		 </details>

		 <h2 id="h-2">Calculate the rebate</h2>

		 <p>For details on how to calculate your total rebate, see guide RC4033, General Application for GST/HST Rebates, under "Part C – Rebate claimed".</p>
		 <p>For the GST/HST rates, go to GST/HST calculator (and rates).</p>

		 <h2 id="h-3">How to file</h2>
<p>Enter the rebate amount for each invoice in the “GST/HST” column of Part F of the application.</p>
		 <h3>Documents to include with the rebate application and to keep for your records</h3>
		 <p>When you apply for a rebate, include all the following information with your application:</p>
		 <ul>
			 <li>The reason the amount is not payable or remittable</li>
			 <li>Details on how you calculated your claim</li>
			 <li>Copies of receipts for all purchases that you list</li>
		 </ul>
		 <p>We will not return any receipts or supporting documents sent with your application. We do not accept credit card slips or debit transaction slips as proof of purchase without a copy of the invoice or cash register receipt.</p>

		 <h2 id="h-4">When to file</h2>
<p>You have two years to file your application after the day that you paid or remitted the amount in error.</p>
		 <p>You can send only one application per calendar month. </p>
