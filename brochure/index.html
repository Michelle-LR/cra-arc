			   <h2>Get a social insurance number (SIN) or tax number</h2>
			    <p>A SIN is a 9-digit number that is personal, confidential, and unique to you.</p>
        <p>You need a SIN to:</p>
        <ul>
                <li>receive benefits and credits</li>
                <li>work in Canada</li>
                <li>open most types of bank accounts</li>
              </ul>
        <p>Go to <strong>Service Canada</strong> to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/sin/apply.html">apply for a SIN</a>.</p>
        <h3>What to do if you can't get a SIN</h3>
        <p>If Service Canada is unable to give you a permanent or temporary SIN, the CRA may give you a temporary tax number (TTN) you may use to get benefits and credits, file taxes, and sign up for CRA's online services.</p>
        <details>
                <summary>How to get a TTN</summary>
                <p>Complete your benefit or credit application or tax return without an account number. Attach a letter explaining why you do not have a SIN or can't get one.</p>
                <p>To get a number faster, you may also include <strong>certified copies</strong> of documents that prove your identity, such as:</p>
                <ul>
            <li>a passport</li>
            <li>a driver's licence</li>
            <li>a birth certificate or proof of birth</li>
            <li>an immigration document showing that your spouse is sponsoring you (if your spouse has a SIN and is sponsoring you)</li>
            <li>a letter from <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship.html">Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada</a> that says they are reviewing your file</li>
          </ul>
              </details>
		   <h2>Determine if you should file a tax return</h2>
		   <p>In order to qualify for certain benefit payments, you will need to file a return, even if you have no tax to pay.</p>
		   <p>Full a full listing on when you must file, refer to: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/you-have-file-a-return.html">When you must file a tax return</a></p>

<h2>Learn about Canadian taxes</h2>	 
<p>Many of the benefits people enjoy in Canada are made possible through taxes. If you are an employee, your employer usually deducts taxes and pays them to the CRA for you.</p>
        <p>Each year, people complete a tax return (Income Tax and Benefit Return) to find out if they owe tax or if they will get money back.</p>
        <p>Understand how the Canadian tax system works: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/educational-programs.html">Learn about your taxes</a></p>
   
	
<h2>Be aware of tax scams</h2>  
		 <p>Be cautious if you are contacted by someone that claims to be from the CRA and requests personal information such as your SIN, credit card number, bank account number, or passport number.</p>
        <p>Scams may contact you by phone, email, mail or instant messaging.</p>
        <p>We will <strong>never</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
                <li>ask you to pay fees using prepaid credit cards, gift cards, or any other similar services</li>
                <li>use aggressive language</li>
