  <p>The excessive interest and financing expenses limitation (EIFEL) rules limit the deductibility of net interest and financing expenses by certain corporations and trusts.</p>
            <p>The EIFEL rules received royal assent on DATE and apply to tax years beginning after September 30, 2023.</p>

    </ul>

            <h2>Who the rules apply to</h2>
            <p>The rules apply to corporations and trusts with interest and financing expenses (IFE) (<a href="link to ITA">link to ITA</a>) or interest and financing revenues (IFR) (<a href="link to ITA">link to ITA</a>) unless they are an excluded entity.</p>
            <p>An excluded entity is defined in subsection 18.2(1) and generally includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>a Canadian-controlled private corporation that, together with all associated corporations, has taxable capital employed in Canada of less then $50 million</li>
                <li>groups of corporations and trusts whose Canadian members have total net IFE that is not more than $1 million</li>
                <li>certain standalone Canadian-resident corporations and trusts, and groups consisting only of Canadian-resident corporations and trusts, which carry on all or most of their businesses, undertaking and activities within Canada and have limited ties to non-residents</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The rules indirectly apply to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>partnerships with a corporation or trust as a member that have IFE or IFR</li>
                <li>controlled foreign affiliates (CFA) that have relevant affiliate IFE (<a href="link to ITA">link to ITA</a>) or relevant affiliate IFR (<a href="link to ITA">link to ITA</a>) if:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>they are a CFA of a taxpayer subject to the EIFEL rules</li>
                    <li>they are a CFA of a partnership with a member subject to the EIFEL rules or a member that is a CFA of a taxpayer subject to the EIFEL rules</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="objective">
            <h2>Objective of the rules</h2>
            <p>The objective of the EIFEL rules is to address base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) concerns. These result from taxpayers deducting excessive interest and financing expenses, which they incurred to produce exempt or deferred income. This is a particular concern in the context of multinational enterprises and cross-border investments. These concerns were identified by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)/G20 in its BEPS Action 4 report.</p>
            <p>The strengthening of the rules on interest deductibility is expected to bring Canada in line with other foreign jurisdictions, including all of our G7 peers to make sure that taxpayers pay their fair share of taxes.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="reporting">
            <h2>How to report</h2>
            <p>You must report information related to the EIFEL rules in your corporation income tax return.</p>
            <h3>EIFEL forms</h3>
            <p>The CRA is currently preparing forms that will allow corporations, trusts and partnerships to meet this reporting requirement.</p>
            <p>The new EIFEL forms are expected to be available during summer 2024. Check this page on a regular basis for updates on when the form will be available.</p>
            <h3>Reporting before EIFEL forms are available</h3>
            <p>If you need to file a tax return for a taxation year subject to the EIFEL rules before the forms are available, report denied interest and financing expenses on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>line 227 of SCH 1 of the T2 return if you are a corporation</li>
                <li>a separate line in “Other income” of Step 2 of the T3 return if you are a trust</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Keeping records</h3>
            <p>Remember to keep all documents to support your calculation of the denied interest and financing expenses. For additional information on your responsibilities and the requirements associated with keeping records, go to <a href="#">Keeping records</a>.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="election">
            <h2>How to make an election</h2>
            <h3>Election provisions</h3>
            <p>The EIFEL rules contain several new election provisions that give you the opportunity to decide on an alternative tax treatment:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Payment of interest of lease financing amount</li>
                <li>Excess capacity of interest and financing expenses (IFE)</li>
                <li>Non-capital loss</li>
                <li>Group ratio rules</li>
                <li>Foreign property</li>
                <li>Transitional rules</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Election forms</h3>
            <p>The forms for these elections are expected to be published for summer 2024.</p>
            <p>If you need to file an election before the forms are published, you may send a letter with the prescribed information, signed by all taxpayers or partnerships who are party to the election. For instructions on how to send the letter, go to <a href="#">Filing a special election or return</a>.</p>
            <h3>Information return requirement waived</h3>
            <p>Normally, an information return must be filed within 6 months of the end of the calendar year if a taxpayer has received capacity to deduct IFE in a joint election made under subsection 18.2(4).</p>
            <p>However, under the CRA administrative policy, the requirement to file this information return is currently being waived.</p>
